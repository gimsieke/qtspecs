<blockquote>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks of discussion[1][2] about naming things, there
seem to be a some quite different perspectives on the problem.</p>
<p>As background, let’s remember that we have a language (or a set of
languages) that evolved over time. We couldn’t anticipate in version
1.0 what we would have in 4.0. We added new features in 2.0 and 3.0
that weren’t anticipated in previous versions either.</p>
<p>We live with decisions (some the result of long and hard battles
within the working group(s)) like the fact that sequences don’t nest
so all individual items are also sequences of length one.</p>
<p>The context for each addition to the language has been roughly: how
can we add new, useful features with a minimum of backwards
incompatibility.</p>
<p>It’s a natural consequence of this sort of evolution that there are
rough edges. Why does fn:count returns the number of items in a
sequence but always returns 1 if the argument is an array? Because an
array is an item and an item is a sequence of length one.</p>
<p>(It doesn’t help that the vision of what the X* languages should be
has changed over time. What started out envisioned as a tool for
transforming documents from one format to another for presentation on
the web or in print has grown into something that at least some
members of the group view as first class, functional programming
languages. That’s not bad, but it puts entirely different stresses on
the design, I think.)</p>
<p>As we add new functions (specifically, in the case of recent
discussions, but I expect the same perspectives apply more generally),
I think one perspective is roughly this:</p>
<p>How can we name and organize the functions so that users are least
likely to be surprised and most likely to be able to figure out how
to solve a particular problem?</p>
<p>Taken to an extreme, this perspective isn’t about changing the
semantics of the functions at all, it’s “just” about naming them. Is
fn:get() better (easier to understand, less confusing) than
fn:items-at?</p>
<p>I think another perspective is roughly this:</p>
<p>We have a messy design. It would be better if we could refactor the
design so that it was more harmonious and logical. We don’t need
four different, closely related functions to get items out of
different sorts of data structures, we need a set of abstractions
that make it obvious that only one function is necessary.</p>
<p>Taken to an extreme, this perspective is about reshaping the whole
language so that a single, obvious set of function names emerges
naturally from the carefully constructed abstractions.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone holds exactly one perspective (discussions about
renaming often involve some level of discussion about semantics, for
example) and I’m attempting to polarize the perspectives a little bit
in an effort to shine light on a larger problem, not to be divisive.</p>
<p>With my chair’s hat on, the main problem I see with the first
perspective is that naming is hard, often personal and emotional, and
will never be wholly logical (so there will always be more to discuss,
so the “problem” is never resolved). It’s not quite fair to say it’s a
distraction from the “bigger” issues we need to resolve, but it does
take a lot of time.</p>
<p>I see the appeal of the second perspective. If we had a green field,
we’d do things differently. I think we might all agree that, ideally,
fn:count should return the number of items in a sequence, the number
of items in an array, and the number of key-value pairs in a map. But
it doesn’t and it can’t without fundamentally breaking things. I don’t
think we’d get agreement to break fn:count, so what can we do?</p>
<p>A proposal to fundamentally redesign the data model would be a tough
sell, I think.</p>
<p>One thing we could do is define a new namespace “gn” with functions
that work more logically, that treat sequences, arrays, and maps, as
collections and operate on them uniformly.</p>
<p>I suppose we could reconstruct the whole set of functions in this new
namespace and focus our efforts there, perhaps going so far as to
deprecate the current fn: namespace in favor of this new one.
But could we get consensus to do that? Would users thank us?</p>
<p>I dunno. Innovations welcome.</p>
<pre><code>                                    Be seeing you,
                                      norm

<p>This issue addresses the 2nd alternative formulated briefly by Norm as:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Here are some of the obvious advantages of having a uniform Kollection concept that covers: arrays, sequences, maps, ... and possibly future new, specific, collection-like datatypes as sets:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Uniform definition and understanding of a single data type - the Kollection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O(N) functions only, compared to O(M * N) at present. Here N is the number of functions needed for each of the current collection-like data types (Arrays, Sequences and Maps) and M is the number of collection-like data types (currently 3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The users will need to know about and understand just the single Kollection data type and its functions, not 3 or more similar collection-like data  types and 3 or more number of similar (but different) functions. Minimizing by a factor of 3 the amount of factual knowledge that a user needs is something HUGE  and extremely positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing users to say "Good Bye" to the unclear and treacherous flat-sequence concepts we have as legacy from XPath 1.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staying aligned to the examples of other modern programming languages such as C# with its IEnumerable interface. It is good to know that this has already been done in other shining programming languages, thus a nay-sayer will not be able to argue that this is not doable or, if done, would be negative to the language and its users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freeing enormous resources and time for the members of the Community Group so that they can spend this on more valuable avenues, than trying to find similar and best names to M similar functions each defined to one of the M current collection-like data types.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, to dispel some plausible myths before they start circulating here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Myth 1: This will break backwards-compatibility? No, as proposed by Norm, all the functions operating on the generalized collection data type can be in a separate, new namespace and thus no existing user-code is affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Myth 2: If a sequence containing a single Kollection still has <code>count()</code> of 1, then what is the use of the Kollection data type? Actually, as proposed by Norm, the Kollection data type and its functions reside in their own namespace. Doing things using only functions from this new namespace eliminates the possibility of using <code>fn:count</code> as it resides in the different, currently existing standard function namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Myth 3: This will be too-complex for the users and the users will not embrace it, so let us not waste time designing it. Wow, there were such prophets saying exactly the same about LINQ in 2005. As it often happens, the future proved them wrong. Users clearly and overwhelmingly "voted with their code" incorporating LINQ in almost all everyday applications and code repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Myth 4: Banning the current functions operating on sequences, arrays and maps would be a huge burden to the users, and would intervene negatively with their programming. In fact, nobody would be banning any of the existing functions. Users can continue to use them forever. The acceptance of the uniform and generalized Kollection data - type can happen gradually with time, as was the case with the addition of LINQ to C#.</p>
</li>
</ol>

This is what the current draft says:</p>
<h3><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-datamodel-40/Overview.html#function-items">XDM, 2.9.4 Function Items</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>identity</strong>: an abstract property that can be used to test whether two variables refer to the same function or to different functions. This property is exposed only for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Currently, the concept of function identity is used for two purposes: firstly, when functions appear in the arguments supplied to the <code>fn:deep-equal</code> function; and secondly, in establishing whether the arguments and results of a function are "the same" when deciding whether the function is deterministic.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Function identity is not currently defined for maps and arrays, because in the circumstances where function identity would otherwise be used, maps and arrays are compared by examining their content.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#properties-of-functions">XQFO, 1.8.4 Properties of functions</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>[…] the two function items have the same function identity. The concept of function identity is explained in Section 2.9.4 Function Items.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-deep-equal">XQFO, 14.2.8 fn:deep-equal</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>c. <code>$i1</code> and <code>$i2</code> have the same function identity. The concept of function identity is explained in Section 2.9.4 Function Items.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-function-lookup">XQFO, 17.1.1 fn:function-lookup</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The function identity is determined in the same way as for a named function reference. Specifically, if there is no context dependency, two calls on <code>fn:function-lookup</code> with the same name and arity must return the same function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I definitely believe in the concept, I believe the documentation is still cryptic, or even impossible, to understand, at least without reading #520 or consuming the existing QT4 test cases. Here are some questions that I’m trying to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does “abstract property” mean that the property will not be materialized in an implementation, or does it mean that the property too vague to be precisely defined?</li>
<li>We should try to specify what “refer to the same function” means. Are function properties that allow us to at least safely identify a subset of functions the same? For example, will <code>true#0</code> and <code>true#0</code> always be identical? The test cases imply this, whereas #520 doesn’t.</li>
<li>In XQFO 17.1.1, there’s a hint that context-dependency influences the decision if functions are identified as equal. Does this mean that <code>name#0</code> and <code>name#0</code> cannot be equal? Or can, or will, they be equal if the context is identical?</li>
<li>The term “deterministic” does not appear anywhere else in the XDM spec, so one is inclined to think of the XQFO nondeterminism. It is then unclear whether two instances of, for example, <code>map:entries</code> and <code>fn:parse-xml</code> can be “the same” if the parameters are the same.</li>
<li>In XQFO 17.1.1, “must return the same function.” is also unclear: What exactly is meant by “same function”? Is it a function that creates an identical result (thus, excluding nondeterministic functions like <code>fn:parse-xml</code>)?</li>
<li>We should explain better what was the motivation to include the context-dependency of functions in the definition. It would certainly be more intuitive if both <code>deep-equal(name#0, name#0)</code> and <code>deep-equal(name#1, name#1)</code> returned <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sorry for not offering good answers in return. I could try to describe what we’ve implemented so far – mostly inspired by the test cases – but I’m not sure if it meets the requirements.</p>

<p>consider</p>
<pre><code>      &lt;xsl:variable name="foo1"&gt;
         &lt;foo/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>question - what is the type of <code>foo1</code>?
answer - (according to my saxon/oxygen setup the answer is) "document-node"</p>
<p>consider</p>
<pre><code>      &lt;xsl:variable name="foo2" as="element(foo)"&gt;
         &lt;foo/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>question - is this code valid then (I would as someone not used to xslt 2+ assume not)?
answer - yes</p>
<p>but surely this code is identical to foo1, so the 'type' of variable is actually changing the interpretation of the expression.</p>
<p>For me that's quite confusing</p>
<p>It would appear that these 2 values are not two different views (interfaces) of the same underlying value, else this</p>
<p><code>     &lt;xsl:variable name="foo3" as="element(foo)" select="$foo1"/&gt;</code></p>
<p>would be valid.</p>
<p>It isnt (i.e. this doesn't appear to be some subtle OO style scenario where an evaluation can have multiple interfaces, here 'document-node' and 'element' are presumably disjoint types).</p>
<p>For me conceptually types are descriptions of expressions, they have no behaviour, yet here they appear to (to me) effect the interpretation, not simply describe it.</p>
<p>For me, I'd prefer a 'strict' mode where either</p>
<pre><code>      &lt;xsl:variable name="foo2" as="element(foo)"&gt;
         &lt;foo/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>is a type error, because the expression is clearly a document-node OR some other mechanism to clarify the ambiguity without this conceptual wrinkle.</p>
<p>An expression should either have 1 interpretation, or if its ambigious, that should be an error, I don't think the language should default to prefer one over another.</p>
<p>P.S.
why doesnt this work? I genuinely don't know how to explicitly declare something as a document-node.</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:variable name="foo1" as=document-node()&gt;
     &lt;foo/&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A consequence of this rule is that you can't have two documents in the same execution scope with the same document-uri() property.</p>
<p>Enforcing this rule causes a lot of trouble. For example at the API level, the user can set two stylesheet or query parameters to two different documents that are associated with the same URI. Another example, two XSLT packages in the same stylesheet can call doc() on the same URI and get different documents back because they have set different validation and whitespace-stripping options. Use of <code>fn:transform()</code> causes further complications when documents are passed across the boundary (in fact that's where we first encountered the problem). And <code>collection()</code> brings further complications.</p>
<p>In order to conform to the rule in the spec, we changed Saxon a while back so the only documents that are guaranteed to have a document-uri() property are those that were read using the doc() function - and even then, things like validation and whitespace variations are troublesome. This causes users much confusion, partly, because of the change from earlier Saxon releases, but more because there are many situations where they would expect document-uri() to give a useful result and it doesn't.</p>
<p>I think we can fix this simply by removing the guarantee. That will cause less inconvenience to users than the current rule. We could perhaps modify it to say that in the case of a document returned from the doc() function, its document-uri() property will be such that a call to doc() with that URI will return the same document, but in the case of documents derived from other sources (for example <code>collection()</code>, or a result from <code>fn:transform</code>) there is no such guarantee.</p>
