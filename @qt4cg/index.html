<p>The problem is that it's not possible, within the XPath/XQuery language, to implement such a function with implicit access to the object on which it is invoked. The implementation of the function does not have access to any kind of <code>$this</code> variable.</p>
<p>This issue considers how we can move forwards from supporting simple records to introduce object capabilities, in an incremental and compatible way.</p>
<p>Here are three steps in that direction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where a named record type is declared, also create a corresponding constructor function. So if you declare</li>
</ol>
<p><code>declare item type my:loc as record(longitude as xs:double, latitude as xs:double)</code></p>
<p>you also get a constructor function allowing my:loc(180, 180), allowing both positional or keyword arguments corresponding to the field names,</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Allow default values to be defined in the record type, which act as default values for the parameters in the constructor function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow functions that are defined as part of a record type access to a variable $this. The constructor function provides an implicit binding of this variable to the record/map/object that is being instantiated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow self-reference to a named record type (and its constructor function) within the record definition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So you can now do:</p>
<pre><code>declare type my:counter as record (
   value as xs:integer,
   increment := fn() as my:counter {my:counter($this?value + 1)}
)
</code></pre>
<p>and then</p>
<pre><code>let $x := my:counter(0)
return $x?increment()?value
</code></pre>
<p>which returns 1.</p>

<p>The current draft uses the type <code>map(xs:integer, xs:string)</code> for the <code>column-names</code> option to <code>fn:csv-to-xdm</code> and <code>fn:csv-to-xml</code>. This PR flips that to <code>map(xs:string, xs:integer)</code>. It turns out that the examples were already using this, and it seems to me that having the <code>names</code> entry in the <code>csv-columns-record</code> record type be the transposed version of the <code>column-names</code> option that creates it, rather than be the same thing, is counterproductive.</p>
<p>I can think of some examples (a CSV split into several chunks, with only the first containing the headers) where being able to feed the <code>names</code> entry right back into another invocation of <code>fn:csv-to-xdm</code> would be useful. If nothing else it's confusing and not obvious, or I wouldn't have messed up the examples, and somebody would have noticed during the review process...</p>

<p>Generators are well known and provided out of the box in many programming languages. Per Wikipedia:</p>
<p>“In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>,  a&nbsp;<strong>generator</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine">routine</a>&nbsp;that can be used to control the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration">iteration</a>&nbsp;behaviour of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops">loop</a>. All generators are also&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator">iterators</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_programming)#cite_note-1">[1]</a>&nbsp;A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array, in that a generator has parameters, can be called, and generates a sequence of values.
However, instead of building an array containing all the values and returning them all at once, a generator yields the values one at a time, which requires less memory and allows the caller to get started processing the first few values immediately. In short, a generator&nbsp;<em>looks like</em>&nbsp;a function but&nbsp;<em>behaves like</em>&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator">iterator</a>.”</p>
<hr>
<h1>The goal of this proposal (major use-cases)</h1>
<p>A generator in XPath should be a tool to easily implement the solutions to the following use-cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Processing a huge collection whose members may not all be needed.<br>
A generator will produce only the next member of the collection and only on demand basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling a collection containing unknown or infinite number of members.
When requested the next member of the collection the generator will always produce it, if the collection still contains any members. It is the responsibility of the caller to issue only the necessary number of requests for the really needed next members.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What is achieved in both cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A (next) member is produced only on request. No time is spent on producing all members of the collection.</li>
<li>A (next) member is produced only on request. No memory is consumed to store all members of the collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good problem that is based on these use-cases is to generate a collection of the first N members that have some wanted properties,  and are generated from other collection(s), when it is not known what the size of the original input collections would be in order for the desired number of N members to be discovered.</p>
<p>For example: <strong><em>Produce the first 1 000 000 (1M) prime numbers</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may not even know if N such wanted members actually exist, for example: <strong><em>Produce the first 2 sequences of 28 prime numbers where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primes_in_arithmetic_progression#Largest_known_primes_in_AP">the primes in each of the sequences form an arithmetic progression</a>.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<h1>The Proposal</h1>
<p>A generator is defined as (and synonym for):</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">let $generator as record
                   (initialized as xs:boolean,
                    endReached as xs:boolean,
                    getCurrent as function(..) as item()*,
                    moveNext as function(..) as .. ,
                    *  ) 
</code></pre>
<p>A generator is an extensible <a href="https://qt4cg.org/pr/715/xquery-40/xpath-40.html#id-record-test"><strong><em>record</em></strong> </a>.</p>
<p>It has four fixed-named keys, and any other map-keys, as required to hold the internal state of that specific generator.</p>
<p>Here is the meaning of  the four fixed/named keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>initialized</em></strong> is a boolean. When a generator <code>$gen</code>  is initially instantiated, <code>$gen?initialized</code> is <code>false()</code>. Any call to <code>$gen?getCurrent()</code> raises an error. In order to get the first value of the represented collection, the caller must call <code>$gen?moveNext()</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>endReached</em></strong> is a boolean. If after a call to <code>moveNext()</code> the value of the returned generator's <code>endReached</code> key is <code>true()</code> then calling <code>moveNext()</code> and/or <code>getCurrent()</code> on this generator raises an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>getCurrent</em></strong> is a function of zero arguments. It must only be called if the values of <code>initialized</code> is <code>true()</code> and the value of <code>endReached</code> is <code>false()</code>, otherwise an error must be raised. This function produces the current member of the collection after the last call to <code>moveNext</code>, if this call didn't return a generator whose <code>endReached</code> value was <code>true()</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>moveNext</em></strong>  is a function of zero arguments. When called on a generator whose <code>endReached</code> value is <code>false()</code> then it produces the next (state of the) generator. including a possibly <code>true()</code> value of <code>endReached</code> and if this value is still <code>false()</code>, then calling <code>getCurrent()</code> produces the value of the next member of the collection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Examples of operations on generators</h1>
<p>The following examples are written in pseudo-code as at the time of writing there was no available implementation of records. And also, the code for recursion in pure XPath makes any such example longer than necessary for grasping its meaning.</p>
<h2>Take the first N members of the collection</h2>
<pre><code class="language-xq">take($gen as generator, $n as xs:integer, $result as array(*) = []) as array(*)

      $result := if(not($gen?endReached) and $n gt 0) then array:append($result, $gen?getCurrent())
   return
    if(not($gen?endReached) and $n gt 0) then take($gen?moveNext(), $n -1, $result)
      else $result
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Skip the first N members from the collection</h2>
<pre><code class="language-xq">skip($gen as generator, $n as xs:integer) as generator

</code></pre>
<h2>Subrange of size N starting at the M-th member</h2>
<pre><code class="language-xq">subrange($gen as generator, $m as xs:integer, $n as xs:integer)
{
  take(skip($gen, $m -1), $n)

</code></pre>
<h2>Head of a generator</h2>
<pre><code class="language-xq">head($gen as generator)

{
   map:put($gen, "getCurrent", function() { $fun($gen?getCurrent()) }  )                              
}
</code></pre>
<h2>For Each Pair</h2>
<pre><code class="language-xq">for-each-pair($gen1 as generator, $gen2 as generator, $fun as function(*))
{
   let $gen1 := if(not($gen1?initialized)) then $gen1?moveNext()
                  else $gen1,
       $gen2 := if(not($gen2?initialized)) then $gen2?moveNext()
                  else $gen2,
    return
      if($gen1?endReached or $gen2?endReached) then map:put($gen1, "endReached", true())
        else map:put(map:put($gen1, "getCurrent", function() { $fun($gen1?getCurrent(), $gen2?getCurrent()) } ) ,
                     "moveNext", function() { for-each-pair(skip($gen1, 1), skip($gen2, 1), $fun)}
                    )                             
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Filter</h2>
<pre><code class="language-xq">filter($gen as generator, $pred as function(item()*) as xs:boolean)

<blockquote>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, we should say in XQuery 4.6.2.4 (Named Function References) that the function created by a named function reference has its annotations taken from the function definition. There are other places where we are not explicit about the annotations of a function item, for example with partial function application. We should add a note that in XPath and XSLT, it is not possible to define function annotations, so this function will always return an empty result. (However, we should consider giving user-defined functions in XSLT annotations based on their attributes, e.g. visibility and streamability).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and my complementary note in the PR thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I decided to merge the PR without changes, and not add the reference to XPath and XSLT, because the function may also return results for XQuery functions imported via fn:load-xquery-module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional notes from today’s meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>For annotations without values, we could assign <code>true()</code> as a default value.</li>
<li>Examples could be added to <code>fn:function-annotations</code> to demonstrate how to check for annotations without values (or with values whose EBV is <code>false()</code>: <code>0</code>, <code>""</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>Dimitre suggested restructuring the spec for features that are not available in XPath.</li>
<li>Maybe annotations would also be helpful in XPath.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free everyone to add more comments.</p>

<p>I think the type for the 3rd argument of <code>fn:sort</code>…</p>
<pre><code>$key  as&nbsp;(function(item()) as xs:anyAtomicType*)+  :=&nbsp;fn:data#1

<p>While it will be rare to encounter queries with <code>key := ()</code>, there seems to be no urgent reason to enforce at least one sort key. The change would also be in alignment with the corresponding rule (with the current signature, <code>$key</code> cannot be empty), which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of sort key definitions is determined by the number of function items supplied in the <code>$key</code> argument. If the argument is absent or empty, the default is a single sort key definition using the function <code>data#1</code>.</p>

It's related to the requirements presented in issue #262 and issue #297.</p>
<p>Firstly, I propose a change to the data model so that annotations can be attached to any item [or perhaps any value?], not only to a function. The annotations are a map of type <code>map{xs:QName, item()*}</code>. Some general principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotations on an item do not affect the result of any operation on that item unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li>Operations that are described as returning a result that contains items that are present in one of the operation's operands retain the annotations of those items, unless otherwise specified. (So for example $a[C] returns a sequence of items from $a in which the annotations are preserved).</li>
<li>Operations that construct "new" items (for example $a + $b) return an item with no annotations, unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li>The function <code>annotations($x)</code> (replacing <code>function-annotations($x)</code>) returns the annotations of an item.</li>
<li>The function annotate($x, key, value) returns a "clone" of $x with an additional annotation. (A clone of an item differs from the original only in having different annotations. All operations other than annotation-sensitive operations produce exactly the same result on the clone and the original - including tests for node identity.)</li>
<li>To avoid confusion, the term "type annotation" is replaced by "type label".</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, we use annotations to aid navigation of JTrees (a term I use to describe trees of arrays and maps such as might be produced by parsing JSON).</p>
<p>We introduce a component of the static context <code>tracked=true|false</code>, defaulting to false. The construct <code>tracked{expression}</code> evaluates an expression and its subexpressions in tracked mode. In tracked mode any operator or function that performs selection within an array or map (for example the lookup operator, the <code>map:get</code> and <code>array:get</code> function, using the map/array as a function item, or the <code>array:head()</code> and <code>array:foot()</code> and <code>map:find()</code> functions) annotates the items in its result with two properties: "container" whose value is the map or array from which the item was selected, and "key" which is the key or array index of the selected value within that container. The effect is that if an item was found in a JTree using a tracked expression, the annotations on the resulting item can be used in effect to navigate upwards within the tree that was searched.</p>
<p>Note that this is not a new idea: in effect, the result of a tracked selection is a <strong>zipper</strong> data structure, as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_(data_structure).</p>
<p>A further exploitation of the idea allows us to introduce deep update of JTree structures. For example, <code>modify(root:=$a, selection:=fn{?x?y?z,} change:=fn{.+1})</code> can evaluate the <code>selection</code> argument in tracked mode, apply the <code>change</code> function to the resulting items, and then navigate back using the <code>container</code> annotation to create modified versions of all traversed containing JTrees, eventually returning a modified version of the <code>root</code> tree.</p>

<p>I've been thinking recently about adding <code>checked{}</code> and <code>unchecked{}</code> modes. For example</p>
<p>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="checked{.//item}"/&gt;</p>
<p>would throw an error if there are no items. The mode of execution would propagate downwards, so <code>checked{a/b/c/d}</code> would be able to tell you that a <code>b</code> was found, but it had no <code>c</code> children.</p>
<p><code>checked{item[22]}</code> would have the effect of making sequences behave more like arrays, with bound checking; conversely <code>unchecked{item?22}</code> would return an empty sequence instead of throwing an error.</p>

<p>The motivations for this are to explore the creation of sequences where the next item in the sequence is determined by evaluating a function on the current state of a system. These sequence generators have an initial starting value and state. They can also stop when some condition is met.</p>
<p>The motivating example here is the <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-random-number-generator">fn:random-number-generator</a> function, where:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>let $rnd := fn:random-number-generator()</code> initializes a new random number sequence with the default seed as its state;</li>
<li><code>let $value := $rnd?number</code> returns the current value of the sequence;</li>
<li><code>let $rnd := $rnd?next()</code> returns the state and value of the next item in the sequence.</li>
</ol>
<p>This has all the properties needed for a forward (left-to-right) generating sequence. To make it a generalized generator sequence, the <code>number</code> field should be renamed <code>value</code>.</p>
<p>NOTE: The <code>fn:random-number-generator</code> function defines an infinite sequence as it has no termination/end of sequence condition.</p>
<h2>Sequence Generators as Record Types</h2>
<p>Therefore, a forward generator sequence could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>declare item-type sequence-generator as record(
    value as item(),
    next as function() as record(value, next, *)?,
    *
);

declare function generated-sequence() as sequence-generator?;
</code></pre>
<p>If calling <code>?next()</code> on a sequence above returns the empty sequence then there are no more values in that sequence.</p>
<p>If the <code>generated-sequence()</code> returns the empty sequence then there are no items in the sequence.</p>
<p>NOTE: This does not currently define reversible sequence support. A <code>reversed</code> property could be provided that returns a <code>sequence-generator</code> that operates on the sequence from right to left. I haven't figured out exactly how this should look, but reversed generator sequences may be better investigated as a separate issue.</p>
<p>NOTE: An implementation can process this sequence iteratively if needed.</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>While this allows generator sequence types to be created, they are -- like <code>fn:random-number-generator()</code> cumbersome to use. This does have the advantage of being backward compatible with <code>fn:random-number-generator()</code>, though.</p>
<p>The problem comes when trying to make these work like sequences. The subtype and function coercion rules should be doable. The other sequence operations like filtering are more complicated to define properly.</p>
<p>However, this has the same issues that allowing <code>array()</code> in <code>fn:*</code> functions has -- how do you differentiate the use cases where the user is working on a sequence of generators, or the generated sequences?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: You can't extend the functions to take a <code>(sequence-type | item()*)</code> parameter as a <code>sequence-type</code> is a subtype of <code>item()</code> which matches <code>item()*</code>. If the functions were to be extended to handle these, then <code>fn:head(fn:random-number-generator())</code> would return a number instead of a map.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sequence Generator Function</h2>
<p>The Kotlin language has a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.sequences/generate-sequence.html">generateSequence</a> function that takes a next function, an optional seed value or construction function, and returns a lazy sequence over that. -- Internally, it is building a Java iterator that produces values from calling the next function. The sequence will terminate when the next value is null.</p>
<p>I propose that -- in addition to the <code>sequence-generator</code> type above -- XPath defines the following function:</p>
<pre><code>declare function fn:sequence($generator as sequence-generator) as item()*;
</code></pre>
<p>This solves the issues in the <em>Analysis</em> section above, and is analogous to <code>array:values</code>. It is implementation defined how the sequence is constructed. -- This allows an implementer to appropriately map the generator to their internal sequence implementation in order to provide lazy evaluation and other operations.</p>
<p>There should also be the following helper function for random numbers:</p>
<pre><code>declare function fn:random-numbers(
    $seed as xs:anyAtomicType? := ()
) as xs:double* {
    fn:random-number-generator() =&gt; fn:sequence()
};
</code></pre>
<p>The user-defined sequences then become e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>let $generator as sequence-generator := map {
    value : 1,
    next : function () { () }
}
return fn:sequence($generator)
</code></pre>

While this is unrewardingly confusing for binary operations (<code>() + 1</code>, <code>() eq 5</code>), it’s wonderful for pipelines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: paths :)
$nodes / a / b / c
(: lookups :)
$data ? 1 ? 2 ? 3
(: simple map operators :)
$data ! do(.) ! something(.)
(: arrow operator works differently, but the syntax is similar:  :)
$data =&gt; do() =&gt; something()
</code></pre>
<p>As far as I can judge, it would be a very simple and user-friendly addition if we extended dynamic function calls to return an empty sequence (instead of raising an error) if the base expression is an empty sequence. This way, the following expressions would all run through:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">let $map := map { 'giovanni': map { 'city': 'roma' } }
return $map('andrea')('city'),
let $data := ()
return $data(1)(2)(3),
()(123),
()()
</code></pre>
<p>Many people use parentheses instead of the lookup operator for accessing maps &amp; arrays, and the proposed change would make the syntax more interchangeable. I believe it would also be useful for function items in general.</p>
