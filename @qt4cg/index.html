<div class="toot" id="created-1094"><h2>Issue #1094 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-1094</span></h2><div class="pubdate">18 Mar at 09:25:09 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1094">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1094</a></div><details><summary>Axis steps in lookup expressions</summary><div class="markup"><p>This issue picks up where issue #341, issue #350, issue #596, issue #960 etc left off - an attempt to find better syntax and semantics for navigation within JTrees (by which I mean trees of maps and arrays). The problems we are addressing are well aired in those previous issues. There are new opportunities for improving navigation within pinned trees, where upwards navigation becomes possible.</p>
<p>Firstly I propose that the existing constructs <code>?*</code>, <code>?key</code>, and <code>?1</code> be treated as abbreviations for <code>?content::*</code>, <code>?content::key</code>, and <code>?content::1</code> respectively. The content axis delivers a flattened sequence of items.</p>
<p>Then I propose we introduce an <code>entry</code> axis. <code>?entry::*</code>, <code>?entry::key</code>, and <code>?entry::1</code> deliver their results as a sequence of key value pairs, in the style of <code>map:pairs()</code>. Arrays for this purpose are treated as maps with integer keys. For example if <code>$A</code> is <code>[(1,2), (3,4)]</code> then <code>$A?entry::*</code> delivers <code>(map{'key':1, 'value':(1,2)}, map{'key':2 'value':(3,4)}</code>.</p>
<p>This applies equally to the deep lookup operator. <code>$A??entry::*</code> returns all the key-value pairs within the JTree rooted at $A, recursively.</p>
<p>We could also consider a <code>value</code> axis which delivers a sequence of arrays containing the values, losing the associated keys.</p>
<p>If values are labelled, as a result of being found by navigating a pinned JTree. then upwards navigation is also possible. For an item in a pinned tree,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>containing-entry::*</code> delivers the containing entry as a key-value pair. Duplicates are eliminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>owner::*</code> delivers the immediately containing map or array as identified by the label</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ownership::*</code> delivers the transitive closure of the <code>owner::*</code> axis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>peer::*</code> delivers <code>owner::*/entry::*</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>following-member::*</code> delivers the subarray of the containing array that follows the current entry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>preceding-member::*</code> delivers the subarray of the containing array thay precedes the current entry</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, improved names for these concepts are welcomed!</p>
<p>In these examples I have used <code>*</code> to select everything on the relevant axis. This can always be replaced by a key specifier K that selects the item only if it is labelled with a key K. So for example ownership::address selects the containing maps and arrays that are themselves in a map entry with key "address".</p>
<p>I think we also need a convenient way to filter the selection by type (see issue #859 for a problem with the current syntax). I propose</p>
<p><code>??content::[record(longitude, latitude)]</code></p>
<p>to select all items in the recursive content that match type <code>record(longitude, latitude)</code></p>
<p>Similarly</p>
<p><code>??entry::[array(xs:integer)+]</code></p>
<p>to select all entries where the value is an array of integers.</p>
<p>Finally, responding to issue #341, I propose that lookup operators should be error free: rather than reporting errors, they should return nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The function concatenates the members of $array and returns them as a sequence. The values are returned in their original order. Arrays contained within members are returned unchanged.</p>
<p>The effect of the function is equivalent to $array?*.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all a bit too vague.</p>
<ul>
<li>the values are not concatenated, at least not in the sense of concat()</li>
<li>it doesn't return the members, it returns their sequence concatenation</li>
<li>the phrase "arrays contained within members" is unclear. The examples reveal that this rule is intended to include arrays that ARE members.</li>
<li>the equivalent expression <code>$array?*</code> allows $array to be things that <code>array:values()</code> doesn't allow (like an empty sequence).</li>
</ul>
<p>More subtly, the introduction to section 19.1 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All functionality on arrays is defined in terms of two primitives:</p>
<p>The function [array:members] decomposes an array to a sequence of value records.
The function [array:of-members] composes an array from a sequence of value records.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the spec for array:values doesn't conform to this guideline.</p>
<p>Try:</p>
<p>The function returns the sequence-concatenation of the members of $array, retaining order. More formally, the effect of the function is equivalent to the expression <code>array:members($array)?value</code>.</p>
<p>and add to the notes:</p>
<p>Unlike array:flatten, the function does not apply recursively to nested arrays.</p>

It would be possible to combine the <code>collation</code> argument and the <code>ascending/descending</code> argument of <code>fn:sort</code> into a single argument, whose value is an optional "ascending|descending" keyword followed by an optional collation URI (whitespace-separated, presumably).</p>
<p>This might seem a little bizarre at first sight, but having a list of collation URIs followed by a list of sort key functions followed by a list of ascending/descending keywords is also a little bizarre, and it would have two advantages - it would make better use of the second argument which is currently nearly always set to <code>()</code>, and it would put the two parts of the order specification (the collation and its direction) in closer proximity. After all, they are used in combination to decide whether one value precedes or follows another.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% convinced by the idea, but it seems worth considering. What do people think?</p>

The first interpretation rule says underscores are first stripped out.</p>
<p>But the grammar provided appears to me to be inconsistent.</p>
<pre><code>IntegerLiteral	   ::=   	Digits
DecimalLiteral	   ::=   	("." Digits) | (Digits "." [0-9]*)
DoubleLiteral	   ::=   	(("." Digits) | (Digits ("." [0-9]*)?)) [eE] [+-]? Digits
Digits	           ::=   	DecDigit ((DecDigit | "_")* DecDigit)?
DecDigit	   ::=   	[0-9]
</code></pre>
<p><code>Digits</code> permits underscores in the grammar, which works in the integer portion of the numeric literal, but when the value exceeds 1 the fractional part is described as <code>[0-9]*</code>. If underscore stripping is a 'pre-parsing' step, then <code>Digits</code> need not mention it at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand if the grammar is defining the sequence of characters that are permitted, then the fractional section in the grammar should also permit underscores, which it plainly does not in the presence of an integer part. (The test <code>seconds-010</code> uses such in an expansion of π.)</p>
<p>An alternative formulation that I think does describe underscores in fractional parts might be:</p>
<pre><code> DecimalLiteral	   ::=   	("." Digits) | (Digits "." Digits?) 
</code></pre>
<p>and similarly for <code>DoubleLiteral</code>. I know this isn't a game-changer, but for those generating grammars, consistency certainly helps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rules for reporting type errors during static analysis have been changed
so that a processor has more freedom to report errors in respect of constructs that
are evidently wrong, such as <code>@price/@value</code>, even though dynamic evaluation
is defined to return an empty sequence rather than an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This change has in fact been discussed and accepted by the group.  See PRs #603 and #884.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Record types are added as a new kind of ItemType, constraining
  the value space of maps.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Record types have become a fundamental feature of much of our work, with many additional capabilities relying on them. They became an official part of the spec with the closure of issue #172.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Local union types are added as a new kind of ItemType, constraining
  the value space of atomic values.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Enumeration types are added as a new kind of <code>ItemType</code>, constraining
the value space of strings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Local union types and enumeration types became an official part of the spec with the acceptance of PR #691</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lookup operator <code>?</code> can now be followed by a string literal, for cases where
map keys are strings other than NCNames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These changes were endorsed by acceptance of PR #926.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rules for value comparisons when comparing values of different types (for example, decimal and double)
have changed to be transitive. A decimal value is no longer converted to double, instead the double is converted
to a decimal without loss of precision. This may affect compatibility in edge cases involving comparison of
values that are numerically very close.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We still have open issues regarding comparison, conversion, and promotion of numeric values. See for example issue #986. So we may yet decide to roll back these changes. For practical purposes it's sensible to treat the current text as status quo, since so many individual changes have been made that unwinding can only be treated as a new issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <code>for member</code> clause is added to FLWOR expressions to allow iteration over
an array.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current specification of <code>for member</code> results from the acceptance of PR #752.</p>

This has never been reviewed or accepted by the group. See §4.1 of the language specifications.</p>
<p>I propose to raise a PR that drops this feature, in order to force discussion as to whether we want it in its current form, or to replace it with something better, or to drop it entirely.</p>

<div class="toot" id="created-1074"><h2>Pull request #1074 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-1074</span></h2><div class="pubdate">13 Mar at 11:42:44 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/pull/1074">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/pull/1074</a></div><details><summary>Confirm status of provisional functions</summary><div class="markup"><p>The purpose of this PR is to bring the current F&amp;O draft specification into a state where it is confirmed as the current status quo accepted by the CG.</p>
<p>The following functions (mainly new, some amended) that have been present in the draft for some while, but with caveats about their status, are confirmed as part of the status quo:</p>
<ul>
<li>fn:slice</li>
<li>fn:format-number</li>
<li>fn:stack-trace</li>
<li>map:filter</li>
<li>map:replace</li>
<li>array:replace</li>
</ul>
<p>The following functions are dropped (for the time being):</p>
<ul>
<li>fn:json</li>
<li>map:substitute</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual PR essentially changes text that alludes to the status of these functions, it does not change the actual specifications.</p>
<p>The current state of qt4tests in relation to these functions is:</p>
<p>fn:slice - OK
fn:format-number - missing tests for recent changes
fn:stack-trace - no tests
map:filter - OK
map:replace - no tests
array:replace - no tests
fn:json - no tests
map:substitute - no tests</p>
