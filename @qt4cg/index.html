When working with binary types currently one has to fall back to string conversions and/or extensions.
A few ideas on nice to have functions that operate on binary types:
-accessing a single byte at a specific position
-splitting binary data at byte boundary (aka binary-subsequence)
-converting to/from a sequence of byte(s)
-joining binary data together
-(optionally) loading data directly as (base64)binary (some extensions are using unparsed-text with proprietary decoding 'x-binarytobase64' to retrieve a base64 castable string)
-standard bit-wise operators and, or, xor, not, rshift, lshift</p>
<p>If considered, then each needs to be discussed in detail separately -ex. which type to support signed/unsigned, 8 bit etc.-, I merely intend as conversation starter in case others encountered similar issues/limitations.</p>
<p><em>p.s.: Not sure if this is the right channel to raise this issue, so feel free to close/move/split accordingly.</em></p>

However, a <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xslt-xquery-serialization-40/Overview-diff.html#serializer">serializer</a> MAY provide an option that allows the encoding phase to be skipped, so that the result of serialization is a stream of Unicode characters.</p>

<p>What is a stream of Unicode characters? AFAIK, Unicode characters cannot be streamed <em>an sich</em> but require some encoding. And how does would such a stream not consist of bytes/octets of one sort or another? A stream of what exactly?</p>

I normally would wield a light editorial hand, but the issues raised in #464 as well as closer reading of the prose convinced me that a wholesale revision would be beneficial. For example, new sequences were described as if the reader already knew about them, but they are really only introduced as the last sentence in many steps.</p>
<p>I have capitalized on the original version of step 1's appeal to <code>array:flatten</code> to abbreviate the description for two of the steps.</p>

<p>I initially reopened <strong><a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/518">the original issue</a></strong>, because there is some useful and needed functionality that the PR and the text of the FO specification do not provide, and we missed to discuss this at the June 13th meeting.</p>
<p><strong>I believe that typically a developer would need to know if the "whole" TC was completely produced, or not, and maybe how many iterations were needed</strong>.</p>
<p>This can be provided if the result of the function was for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xq">map{ 
        "TC" : $thefinalTCNodeset,
        "WasTCComplete": $boolForTCCompletion,
        "NumberOfIterations: $someInteger
       }
</code></pre>
<p>One could argue that if <strong><em><code>$result? NumberOfIterations &lt; max</code></em></strong>, then we know that the complete TC was produced and thus we don't need the member "WasTCComplete".</p>
<p>However, this is not the case when <strong><em><code>$result? NumberOfIterations eq max</code></em></strong>. In this case both outcomes are possible: the complete TC was produced exactly in <code>max</code> iterations (so the value of <code>"WasTCComplete"</code>  must be <code>true()</code> ), or <code>max</code> iterations were performed and the <code>max + 1</code>st iteration produced additional nodes -- in this case <code>"WasTCComplete"</code> must be <code>false()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Failure to produce the complete TC in many cases will be regarded as error, and the developer needs to be sure that this was (or this wasn't) the case</strong>.</p>
<p>thus, the current specification of this function needs additional work to accomodate the full needed functionality.</p>

<p>The draft specification for fn:differences was added to the spec before we had a review process in place. The spec is complex and incomplete; issue #316 points out some of the difficulties. This PR removes it from the spec.</p>
<p>Note that fn:deep-equal() now has a debug option which outputs diagnostic information in implementation-defined format; although not interoperable, this meets the main use case, which is to discover for diagnostic purposes why and in what way two values are not deep-equal to each other.</p>
