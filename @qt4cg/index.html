In most current cases, if a function argument is supplied, it must be non-empty:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">map:get(

  $key       as xs:anyAtomicType,
  $fallback  as function(xs:anyAtomicType) as item()*  := void#1

<p>In some cases, it’s optional:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">fn:replace(

  $pattern      as xs:string,

<p>As a result, <code>map:get($map, fallback := ())</code> is invalid, while <code>replace($string, $pattern, action := ())</code>  would be valid.</p>
<p>I think it’s better to enforce non-empty arguments (provided that a single item is expected).</p>

<p>There are a number of situations in which error behaviour is insufficiently specified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the partial function application <code>fn:contains(?, 23)</code>, where the second argument is an integer, not a string. Does the partial application fail, or does it result in a function item that fails when dynamically evaluated? The spec does not say.</li>
<li>Consider the expression <code>function-lookup(fn:name, 0</code>) evaluated when there is no context item in the dynamic context. Does the call on function-lookup fail, or does it return a function item that fails when dynamically evaluated? The spec does not say, though there are numerous test cases in the function-lookup test set that suggest the latter.</li>
<li>The same is true for the expression <code>fn:name#0</code> evaluated when there is no context item in the dynamic context.</li>
<li>Consider a user-defined function <code>my:f</code> with a parameter that has a default value of "."; consider both a function reference <code>my:f#0</code> and a partial application <code>my:f(?)</code> evaluated when there is no context item. Again, I think the spec is unclear on the error behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>It feels to me that the right thing to do in all these cases is to raise the error early: that is, to fail at the point where a function item is being constructed, not at the point where the function item is subsequently evaluated. However, this disagrees with QT3 expected test results for tests such as <code>fn-function-lookup-267</code> and <code>function-literal-267</code>.</p>

<p>We should extend <code>fn:compare</code> to support arbitrary atomic types. The comparison rules…</p>
<ul>
<li>would be unchanged for strings,</li>
<li>would rely on <code>fn:numeric-compare</code> for numbers, and</li>
<li>would rely on the existing <code>op:</code> functions for the remaining types.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the rule for dates would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> is returned if <code>op:date-equal(A, B)</code> is <code>true</code>,</li>
<li><code>-1</code> is returned if <code>op:date-less-than(A, B)</code> is <code>true</code>,</li>
<li><code>1</code> is returned otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some types will be rejected (<code>xs:duration</code>, <code>xs:QName</code>, <code>xs:NOTATION</code>, Gregorian types).</p>
<p>In addition, I would vote for making <code>fn:numeric-compare</code> and <code>fn:atomic-equal</code> private. I don’t see a benefit to expose them; I rather expect people to be confused.</p>

<p>Although we define it as "A named function reference is an expression (written name#arity) which evaluates to a [function item]", the term "named function reference" perpetuates the incorrect assumption that it is some kind of literal or constant denoting a function item.</p>
<p>Of course, in many cases it can be treated as just that. But not when the function is context-dependent, for example name#0 or lang#1.</p>
<p>The term is also questionable because one would assume that a "named function reference" is a reference to a "named function", but there is no such concept as a "named function".</p>
<p>So what might be a better name? What the expression actually does (when evaluated) is to search the static context for a function definition whose name and arity range correspond, and then construct a function item that captures the relevant part of the dynamic context in its closure. It's hard to encapsulate all of that in a simple name for the construct, but I would suggest <strong>named function generator</strong>. This is sufficiently close to the current term to be recognisable, but tries to capture the fact that it's not just a constant or literal, it's an expression that activately does something when evaluated; and it's reasonably accurate in that the result of the evaluation is a function item that has a non-absent name.</p>

<p>I don't propose to change the error code.</p>
<p>The only practical distinction is that this will allow the error to be reported statically when it can be detected statically, for example if the user writes something like</p>
<pre><code>function($x as node()) {
  starts-with(name(), 'x')
}
</code></pre>
<p>At present Saxon will give you a compile-time warning for this, followed by a run-time error if the code is actually executed; this is the required behaviour for dynamic errors.</p>
<p>The change does mean that in a case like this example, it will no longer be possible to catch the error using try/catch. However, type errors can only be reported statically if the code is bound to fail at run-time, and catching errors that occur every time is not especially useful.</p>

<p>I've been assuming, though I'm not sure we ever discussed it, that this automatically means that the two types can be "atomic equal" from the point of view of entries in maps: that is, a hexBinary representation of a particular binary value can no longer coexist in a map with a base64Binary representation of the same binary value.</p>
<p>If we were starting from scratch this would clearly make sense, but it has some messy implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a backwards incompatibility; in 3.1 you could construct maps that you can no longer construct in 4.0</li>
<li>It potentially affects interoperability of 3.1 and 4.0 applications. For example, an XQuery 4.0 application invoking an XSLT 3.0 transformation via <code>fn:transform</code> might get back a map that's not a valid map in 4.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>In effect, this is not just a change to the behaviour of one function/operator, it is a data model change, because it changes the value space of the <code>map(*)</code> data type.</p>
<p>And more parochially, I freely admit, there's a lot of internal complexity trying to maintain a code base that supports both the 3.1 and 4.0 rules simultaneously.</p>
<p>Is this a feature that benefits users sufficiently to justify the transition complexities? Note that we can still support "eq" between the two data types without supporting <code>fn:atomic-equal</code>.</p>

<p>The proposal introduces a new fn:numeric-compare function that differs from lt/eq primarily in that decimals are compared retaining their full precision, rather than converting them to doubles which may lose precision. This makes the comparison fully transitive which makes it safe to use in all sorting algorithms.</p>
<p>The new comparison semantics are exploited in max(), min(), and sort(), and indirectly in highest() and lowest(); they are also referenced for comparing numeric values in XSLT <code>xsl:sort</code> (and therefore indirectly in <code>xsl:merge</code>) and in XQuery <code>order by</code>.</p>

<p>Compare to 5.3.2, <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#codepoint-collation">Unicode Codepoint Collation</a>, which describes a similar recursive item-for-item comparison. Interesting formal differences (e.g., unordered list versus ordered list).</p>
<p><a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-deep-equal">fn:deep-equal()</a> is similar, but it is also much more complex. Nevertheless, the way it breaks down the problem at the outset, to dispense immediately with the recursive factor, and deal simply with the rules for equality, is IMO admirable.</p>
<p>It would be nice if there were a bit more consistency in the prose and presentation of recursive rules. Do others agree, and are there other functions/operations that should be considered in this question? I'm thinking immediately only of comparator functions/operations, not functions that use recursion to filter or create. (There may be parallels, but let's start with those functions that are most similar.)</p>

But these three functions have no direct bearing on QNames in either input or output.</p>
<p>Two options occur to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move sections 10.2.6-8 to fall after 13.3.</li>
<li>Rename chapter 10 to "Functions related to QNames and namespaces". Create a 10.3 that pertains exclusively to namespaces. Move to this new subchapter 10.2.4, 10.2.6-8, as well as 13.3 <code>fn:namespace-uri()</code> .</li>
</ol>
<p>Or some variant of the above.</p>
<p>At any rate, I think the current placement doesn't properly expose these functions to the browsing reader.</p>
