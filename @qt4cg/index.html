<p>I have introduced select examples, to illustrate points in the corresponding rules.</p>
<p>The notes I have introduced need some context. Option 9 for the primary format token is somewhat vague, and the attached note of clarification stokes the imagination. I have trimmed that note for clarity (without substantive changes) but introduced a set of notes later, to help caution developers on unexpected behaviors with option 9, and secondarily to caution processor implementers on the challenges inherent in supporting this option. If  I had my druthers, I would advocate deprecating option 9. It is--to use a technical term--squishy.</p>

Many other languages provide a similar function: The returned output can possibly help to understand which function calls led to an error during the evaluation of a code.</p>
<p>Still, I have strong doubts that it is a good decision to include this function in the standard:</p>
<p>The specification gives you a vast amount of freedom how to implement and optimize things. As a result, itโs completely feasible and reasonable to rewrite the following codeโฆ</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare function local:double($f) {
  $f * 2
};
(1 to 6) ! local:double(.)
</code></pre>
<p>โฆto <code>(1 to 6) ! (. * 2)</code> at compile time. If a user adds a <code>fn:stack-overflow</code> call in the function body, sยทhe would expect to find the function invocation of the original code representation in the output. As always, there are technical solutions to achieve this (store additional information in the evaluation tree on the original query; suppress optimizations when <code>fn:stack-trace</code> is found), but all of them can affect the runtime behavior and lead to different evaluation trees, hiding possible bugs in the implementation (which can be a reason to call <code>fn:stack-trace</code> at all).</p>
<p>A standard should provide a minimum amount of assurance that a function behaves similarly across different implementations. At this time, I donโt believe we canโt give that guarantee.</p>
<p>Related: #55, #686</p>
<p>โ As an alternative, a stack trace could optionally be created by an implementation when an error is triggered.</p>

<p>For union types (including both schema-defined and locally-defined union types), the rules appear to need some further work. Given types <code>R1</code> and <code>R2</code> that are defined by restriction from <code>B1</code> and <code>B2</code>, if an atomic value <code>V</code> is an instance of <code>B1</code> that conforms to the rules of <code>R1</code>, then the relabelling coercion means it V will now be acceptable where the required type is <code>R1</code>. But if the required type is <code>union(R1, R2)</code>, the relabelling coercion is not invoked. This feels inconsistent, since <code>union(R1, R2)</code> might be expected to accept anything that <code>R1</code> accepts.</p>

<p>Constructor functions for user-defined types are very poorly described:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's unclear how anonymous types are handled. The spec says there is a constructor function for every simple type in the static context. That would include anonymous types. But constructor functions for anonymous types, if they exist, are essentially useless, because their names are not known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The semantics of constructor functions for user-defined list and union types are described very vaguely, by analogy with built-in types; and the analogy points to the section on built-in atomic types which doesn't cover union and list types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a union type <code>U</code>, it says that the return type of the constructor U(x) is defined as <code>xs:anyAtomicType</code>. Why not define it as <code>U</code>? Perhaps this predates the ability to use union types as return types.</p>

The problem is that <code>fn:trace()</code> and <code>fn:log()</code> introduce the terms "trace output" with no definition or explanation, and this is easily confused with the primary output defined by the function signatures, and affects how readers think about the determinism of the functions. "The serialization of the trace output..." implies that the processor will necessarily serialize something, but I doubt that can or should be presumed. More needs to be said about the responsibilities of the processor in the contract for these functions.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this section would benefit from a brief preamble, providing context to set the stage for the rules. Some draft text for us to discuss:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diagnostic tracing functions provide a transfer of information, either from the processor to the dynamic context, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The function that transfers information from the processor to the dynamic context, <code>fn:stack-trace()</code>, returns a string that can be further processed and used in the XPath expression and elsewhere in a host language.</p>
<p>The functions that transfer information from the dynamic context to the processor, <code>fn:trace()</code> and <code>fn:log()</code>, each have two effects. The first effect, the output, pertains to the returned values, defined by the function signature and essential to the XPath expression. Such output is always deterministic. The second effect, processor behavior, concerns the way the processor handles the values bound to the parameters, supplied for diagnostic tracing. Processor behavior is always directed toward the user or environment that invoked the processor. Actions may include sending messages, serializing the values and writing them to a log file or database, or something else. Unlike the output (the first effect), the results of processor behavior are implementation-defined and nondeterministic with respect to order of the parameter values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The draft above attempts to avoid "output" to describe the processor-side diagnostics, so as to avoid potential confusion when dealing with the return-type defined in the signature. Where "trace output" appears in each of the rules, "processor behavior" can be used instead.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any objections, corrections, or suggestions?</li>
<li>Any other examples of how a processor might use trace diagnostics?</li>
<li>Should a paragraph be added to explain briefly how <code>trace()</code> and <code>log()</code> differ from <code>xsl:message</code>? (E.g., a serialized tree should not be presumed.)</li>
<li>In the informal Balisage birds-of-a-feather discussion this summer, reservations were expressed by participants about the name <code>log()</code>. Is it possible to drop the function and simply extend the arity of <code>trace()</code> with a parameter <code>$return-input as xs:boolean? := true()</code>?</li>
</ul>
