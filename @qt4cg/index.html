<blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking recently about adding <code>checked{}</code> and <code>unchecked{}</code> modes. For example</p>
<p>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="checked{.//item}"/&gt;</p>
<p>would throw an error if there are no items. The mode of execution would propagate downwards, so <code>checked{a/b/c/d}</code> would be able to tell you that a <code>b</code> was found, but it had no <code>c</code> children.</p>
<p><code>checked{item[22]}</code> would have the effect of making sequences behave more like arrays, with bound checking; conversely <code>unchecked{item?22}</code> would return an empty sequence instead of throwing an error.</p>

<div class="toot" id="created-708"><h2>Issue #708 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-708</span></h2><div class="pubdate">17 Sep at 08:56:39 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/708">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/708</a></div><details><summary>Toward a design for generators</summary><div class="markup"><h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The motivations for this are to explore the creation of sequences where the next item in the sequence is determined by evaluating a function on the current state of a system. These sequence generators have an initial starting value and state. They can also stop when some condition is met.</p>
<p>The motivating example here is the <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#func-random-number-generator">fn:random-number-generator</a> function, where:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>let $rnd := fn:random-number-generator()</code> initializes a new random number sequence with the default seed as its state;</li>
<li><code>let $value := $rnd?number</code> returns the current value of the sequence;</li>
<li><code>let $rnd := $rnd?next()</code> returns the state and value of the next item in the sequence.</li>
</ol>
<p>This has all the properties needed for a forward (left-to-right) generating sequence. To make it a generalized generator sequence, the <code>number</code> field should be renamed <code>value</code>.</p>
<p>NOTE: The <code>fn:random-number-generator</code> function defines an infinite sequence as it has no termination/end of sequence condition.</p>
<h2>Sequence Generators as Record Types</h2>
<p>Therefore, a forward generator sequence could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>declare item-type sequence-generator as record(
    value as item(),
    next as function() as record(value, next, *)?,
    *
);

declare function generated-sequence() as sequence-generator?;
</code></pre>
<p>If calling <code>?next()</code> on a sequence above returns the empty sequence then there are no more values in that sequence.</p>
<p>If the <code>generated-sequence()</code> returns the empty sequence then there are no items in the sequence.</p>
<p>NOTE: This does not currently define reversible sequence support. A <code>reversed</code> property could be provided that returns a <code>sequence-generator</code> that operates on the sequence from right to left. I haven't figured out exactly how this should look, but reversed generator sequences may be better investigated as a separate issue.</p>
<p>NOTE: An implementation can process this sequence iteratively if needed.</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>While this allows generator sequence types to be created, they are -- like <code>fn:random-number-generator()</code> cumbersome to use. This does have the advantage of being backward compatible with <code>fn:random-number-generator()</code>, though.</p>
<p>The problem comes when trying to make these work like sequences. The subtype and function coercion rules should be doable. The other sequence operations like filtering are more complicated to define properly.</p>
<p>However, this has the same issues that allowing <code>array()</code> in <code>fn:*</code> functions has -- how do you differentiate the use cases where the user is working on a sequence of generators, or the generated sequences?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: You can't extend the functions to take a <code>(sequence-type | item()*)</code> parameter as a <code>sequence-type</code> is a subtype of <code>item()</code> which matches <code>item()*</code>. If the functions were to be extended to handle these, then <code>fn:head(fn:random-number-generator())</code> would return a number instead of a map.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sequence Generator Function</h2>
<p>The Kotlin language has a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.sequences/generate-sequence.html">generateSequence</a> function that takes a next function, an optional seed value or construction function, and returns a lazy sequence over that. -- Internally, it is building a Java iterator that produces values from calling the next function. The sequence will terminate when the next value is null.</p>
<p>I propose that -- in addition to the <code>sequence-generator</code> type above -- XPath defines the following function:</p>
<pre><code>declare function fn:sequence($generator as sequence-generator) as item()*;
</code></pre>
<p>This solves the issues in the <em>Analysis</em> section above, and is analogous to <code>array:values</code>. It is implementation defined how the sequence is constructed. -- This allows an implementer to appropriately map the generator to their internal sequence implementation in order to provide lazy evaluation and other operations.</p>
<p>There should also be the following helper function for random numbers:</p>
<pre><code>declare function fn:random-numbers(
    $seed as xs:anyAtomicType? := ()
) as xs:double* {
    fn:random-number-generator() =&gt; fn:sequence()
};
</code></pre>
<p>The user-defined sequences then become e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>let $generator as sequence-generator := map {
    value : 1,
    next : function () { () }
}
return fn:sequence($generator)
</code></pre>

While this is unrewardingly confusing for binary operations (<code>() + 1</code>, <code>() eq 5</code>), it’s wonderful for pipelines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: paths :)
$nodes / a / b / c
(: lookups :)
$data ? 1 ? 2 ? 3
(: simple map operators :)
$data ! do(.) ! something(.)
(: arrow operator works differently, but the syntax is similar:  :)
$data =&gt; do() =&gt; something()
</code></pre>
<p>As far as I can judge, it would be a very simple and user-friendly addition if we extended dynamic function calls to return an empty sequence (instead of raising an error) if the base expression is an empty sequence. This way, the following expressions would all run through:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">let $map := map { 'giovanni': map { 'city': 'roma' } }
return $map('andrea')('city'),
let $data := ()
return $data(1)(2)(3),
()(123),
()()
</code></pre>
<p>Many people use parentheses instead of the lookup operator for accessing maps &amp; arrays, and the proposed change would make the syntax more interchangeable. I believe it would also be useful for function items in general.</p>

<div class="toot" id="created-706"><h2>Issue #706 created<span class="toot-id"> #created-706</span></h2><div class="pubdate">15 Sep at 14:45:33 GMT</div><div class="link">Link: <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/706">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/706</a></div><details><summary>FLWOR: for member $m1 in $a1, member $m2 in $a2</summary><div class="markup"><p>Currently, the <code>member</code> keyword must always be placed directly after the <code>for</code> clause:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: valid :)
for $a in 1 to 10
for $m member $m in $array

(: invalid :)
for $a in 1 to 10, member $m in $array
</code></pre>
<p>In addition, the keyword applies to all other bindings in the same <code>for</code> clause:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">for member $m1 in $array1, $m2 in $array2
</code></pre>
<p>My feeling is that this syntax is a bit odd, as other keywords (<code>allowing empty</code>, <code>at</code>) only refer to the currently bound variable. Next, the <code>member</code> syntax would differ from the semantics of XQuery Full Text: The <code>score</code> keyword is placed before the variable name, and can be used more than once (or omitted):</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">let score $s1 := $data1, score $s2 := $data2
</code></pre>
<p>I think we should change this. It would also simplify the grammar:</p>
<pre><code>InitialClause     ::=  ForClause | LetClause | WindowClause
ForClause         ::=  "for" ForBinding ("," ForBinding)*
ForBinding        ::=  (SimpleForBinding | ForMemberBinding) PositionalVar? "in" ExprSingle
SimpleForBinding  ::=  VarBinding AllowingEmpty?
ForMemberBinding  ::=  "member" VarBinding
AllowingEmpty     ::=  "allowing" "empty"
PositionalVar     ::=  "at" "$" VarName
VarBinding        ::=  "$" VarName TypeDeclaration?
</code></pre>
<p>And one more motivation for changing is that map bindings will be easier to define (see <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/31#issuecomment-1721400625">#31</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If F has lower arity than the expected type, then F is wrapped in a new function that declares and ignores the additional argument; the following steps are then applied to this new function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I got it right, this is the resulting 4.0 behavior:</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> I probably got it wrong, see the next comment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">declare function local:function($a) { };
declare variable $function := function($a) { };

(: now legal :)
filter    (1984, true#0)
$function (1984, 'ignored')
fn { }    (1984, 'ignored')
map { }   (1984, 'ignored')
true#0    ('ignored')
sum(?, ())(1984, 'ignored')

(: still illegal :)
local:function(1984, 'ignored')

(: still legal: RHS items will be supplied one by one :)
map { }(1984, 'processed')     
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe some more examples should be added in the corresponding sections that refer to function coercion.</p>
<p>The new rule is powerful and allows for greater flexibility (see #516 and other issues), but the behavior may also be unexpected. We should probably document that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may go unnoticed that a passed on argument will be ignored. In other words, we reduce type safety by allowing users to supply more arguments than will be processed.</li>
<li>It makes a difference whether the invoked function is static or dynamic (dynamic functions will now provide less type safety than static functions).</li>
</ul>

<p>I propose <code>A!!B</code> as a mapping operator for arrays. Unlike <code>!</code>, this does not flatten the result. The result is an array whose members correspond one-to-one with the members of <code>A</code>, each member of the result array being formed by evaluating <code>B</code> with the corresponding member of <code>A</code> as the context value.</p>
<p>For an array whose members are singletons, the expression <code>A!!B</code> has a similar effect to <code>A?*!B</code>, but (a) it is clearer, (b) it returns an array rather than a sequence, and (c) it performs no flattening. For the more general case, it can be used in place of the higher-order function call <code>A =&gt; array:for-each(fn{B})</code>.</p>
<p>I propose <code>A?[B]</code> as a filter operator for arrays. Unlike <code>A[B]</code>, this is not overloaded to perform index-based selection. The result is an array containing those members of <code>A</code> for which <code>B</code> has an effective boolean value of true, when evaluated with the corresponding member of <code>A</code> as the context value. The expression <code>$A?[B]</code> is equivalent to <code>$A =&gt; array:filter(fn{B})</code>.</p>
<p>For example, <code>$A?[exists(.)]</code> filters the array <code>$A</code> to retain only those members that are non-empty.</p>

<p>The notes I have introduced need some context. Option 9 for the primary format token is somewhat vague, and the attached note of clarification stokes the imagination. I have trimmed that note for clarity (without substantive changes) but introduced a set of notes later, to help caution developers on unexpected behaviors with option 9, and secondarily to caution processor implementers on the challenges inherent in supporting this option. If  I had my druthers, I would advocate deprecating option 9. It is--to use a technical term--squishy.</p>
<p>Spec editors: I am happy to pull back on any of this.</p>
