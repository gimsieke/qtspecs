The intention is to reduce clutter and to improve the readability where code samples (either expressions or results) need multi-line rendition.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of cases the change is clearly (IMHO) an improvement, but further tweaking is possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be scope for tailoring the CSS (for example, I don't like the fact that table cells are centred vertically).</li>
<li>Some of the tables (e.g. parse-uri examples) take too much horizontal space; the code should be edited to reduce the line length</li>
<li>Examples are sometimes introduced with a free-standing paragraph tag rather than with fo:preamble, which separates the introduction from the code into a separate table row.</li>
<li>Some of the examples that were designed for inline rendition could usefully take advantage of the opportunity to turn them into multi-line code samples.</li>

<p>I've tried to cover off most of what was discussed in that issue, but I have avoided dealing with backlash escapes (per @ChristianGruen's early comment), sticking with the RFC 4180 quoting approach.</p>
<p>There are some issues with the structure where I tried to follow the existing structure of chapter 15, but that leaves the function definition in 15.4 separated by a lot of text before the wider format discussion in 15.7. The split between function def and context affects the JSON and HTML parsing functions too, so I have avoided trying to fix that as well in this PR.</p>
<p>If this meets with approval, I'll squash commits and rebase before merging.</p>

<p>The rationale for doing it is discussed at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1580647/json-why-are-forward-slashes-escaped</p>
<p>The short summary is that it's only needed when JSON is inserted into an HTML <code>script</code> element, and then only when immediately followed by <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>There's a workaround using character maps but it's really clumsy.</p>
<p>I don't want to escape forward slashes by default in the xdm-to-json() function because they appear so often in namespaces and it adds an awful lot of visual clutter. That means that our JSON formatter needs an option to suppress this escaping, which means we might as well provide user control over it as an output property...</p>
<p>Adding a new output property just for this purpose is rather heavyweight both in the specs and in our implementation, but I can't think of a better solution. So I propose adding <code>escape-solidus</code>, values yes/no, default (for compatibility) yes.</p>
<p>Yes, someone will ask about the name. Surely no-one calls it a solidus? Well, Unicode does, and I think we should use the official name. And it avoids arguing about whether it should be slash or forwards-slash or forward-slash. At least I'm not proposing virgule.</p>

<ol>
<li>I think a better name for the function might be <code>fn:to-json</code>. Any other suggestions?</li>
<li>Where we specify that a JSON object should be output with particular properties, I think we should be consistent about whether or not we prescribe the order. Writing tests is a lot easier if the order is always prescribed!</li>
<li>Document nodes: it would be better to output both the document URI and the base URI where available.</li>
<li>Under "The children of the element are processed as follows" there are four rules. In the case where an element has just one element node child, I think rule 4 should apply rather than rule 3.</li>
<li>Under Processing-Instruction nodes: typo "A JSON object with a two properties".</li>
<li>The section starting "Strings are escaped as follows" should be promoted up a level.</li>
<li>Representing functions: I propose a different set of rules. (a) for a function that is a reference to a built-in or user-defined function definition, output "Q{uri}local#arity". (b) for an anonymous function, output "#anonymous-function". The rationale is that the JSON output here isn't going to be useful except as a placeholder to indicate that a function item is present.</li>
<li>We might want to be more prescriptive about how numbers are formatted (or to provide user options)</li>
<li>Like many XML-to-JSON libraries, there's the problem that two instances of the same element type might be output very differently depending on which children are present. For example the representation of a book with two authors might be very different from a book with one author. I would suggest that rather than the boolean <code>element-map</code> option, we allow the options to include a list of element names for which <code>object</code> representation rather than <code>array</code> representation is to be used.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because the returned map contains function items, which always have a fixed arity, I think it needs to contain one entry for each arity in the arity range. This involves evaluating the defaults for any parameters that have a default value defined; if the default value is context dependent, this is going to have to use the context of the <code>load-xquery-module()</code> function call, which isn't very meaningful, but I can't see what else to do.</p>
<p>An alternative is to only include one function item in the result, corresponding to the maximum arity.</p>
<p>If we introduce sequence-variadic functions, the arity range becomes infinite, which makes both of these ideas problematic. But presumably sequence-variadic functions will be callable with all the values supplied in a single array?</p>

<p>issue #520 - function identity
issue #333 - equality of function items
issue #381 - deep-equal comparison without errors</p>
<p>The PR introduces a concept of function identity in the data model, and for all expressions that create functions, explains what the identity of the returned function is.</p>
<p>The concept of function identity is used initially in two places: in fn:deep-equal(), when the operands include function items; and in the F+O prose defining the concept of determinism, which in turn is relied on by the definition of memo functions in XSLT.</p>
<p>I had hoped to go further and address issue #119, generalising what kinds of values are allowed as keys in maps, but as explained in a comment on that issue, I hit obstacles.</p>
