Currently, XPath is used for compact equivalencies, for example…</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: array:size :)
count(array:members($array))

(: fn:remove :)
$input[not(position() = $positions)].
</code></pre>
<p>...while XQuery is used for more complex expressions, including function declarations, or when the XPath representation would be syntactically more complex. Examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">(: fn:deep-equal :)
declare function equal-strings(
  $string1   as xs:string,
  $string2   as xs:string, 
  $collation as xs:string,
  $options   as map(*)
) as xs:boolean {
  let $n1 := if ($options?whitespace = "normalize"))
             then normalize-unicode(?, $options?normalization-form) 
             else identity#1
  let $n2 := if ($options?normalize-space)
             then normalize-space#1 
             else identity#1               
  return compare($n1($n2($string1)), $n1($n2($string2)), $collation) eq 0    
}

(: fn:index-where :)
for $item at $pos in $input
where $predicate($item, $pos)
return $pos

(: …flatten, fold-left, while-do, others :)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we have many cases in which XPath/XQuery code is omitted, either because the presented feature is basic enough, because the equivalent code would get too complicated, or (e.g., for <code>fn:doc</code>) because it does not provide means to express the feature.</p>
<p>We should strive for consistency and decide which language(s) the majority of us believes is the best choice…</p>
<ol>
<li>XPath &amp; XQuery (what we currently have)</li>
<li>XPath only</li>
<li>XPath, XQuery and XSLT (whatever seems most appropriate)</li>
<li>Other pseudocode</li>
</ol>

<p>This lets you do things like</p>
<pre><code>  replace( ., '
     / ( [^/]+ ) (*positive_lookahead: /)
    ', '...', 'x')
</code></pre>
<p>replacing components between /..../ but not consuming the trailing /, so that
/a/b/c/d/ comes out as /../../../../</p>
<p>Perl uses
(?=pattern), (*pla:pattern), (*positive_lookahead:pattern)
(?!pattern), (*nla:pattern), (*negative_lookahead:pattern)
to match only if the pattern is (or is not) followed by a match to pattern,</p>
<p>and
(?&lt;=pattern), \K, (*plb:pattern), (*popsitive_lookbehind:pattern)
(?&lt;!pattern), (*nlb:pattern), (*negative_lookbehind:pattern)
for zero-width look-behind assertions.</p>
<p>Note, libpcre (and older Perl version) restrict lookbehind assertions to fixed length. You can write
(?&lt;=dog|cat) food
to match " food" preceded by "dog" or "cat", but you cannot write
(?&lt;=dogs?|cats?) barking</p>
<p>\C is also forbidden, as are capturing subgroups. But the facility is still very useful, and reduces the need for repeated substitutions.</p>
<p>I propose adding only the first form in each case, not the newer "*" forms, which are less widely supported.</p>

<li>Second parameter <code>$algorithm</code> replaced with an option map. In the specs I avoided <code>fos:values/fos:value</code>, because this would disallow for case/space normalization, and it would effectively disallow any implement-defined algorithms not on the list of three algorithms, and trigger the dynamic error described in rule 6 in the <a href="https://qt4cg.org/specifications/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html#option-parameter-conventions">option parameter conventions</a>.</li>
<li>Options map has only one option. It doesn't make sense to provide an option changing the kind of output.</li>

<p>The only difficulty in extending it is how to define a suitable identity comparator so we know when to terminate. Probably this should be done using a callback, defaulting to <code>op('is')</code>. In the use case of PR #988, the comparator could be supplied as <code>false#0</code> - the step function is acyclic, so we can treat all items reached as distinct.</p>

<p>i’m not sure this is easily discoverable.</p>
<p>Note, 'a' to 'z' is obviously dependent on the current collation - if you're using EBCDIC may the dogs help you. I’m assuming, however, any two Unicode characters could appear in the string literals, and it’d be an error to have more than one character in either string.</p>
<p>This means 'ċ' to 'ŗ’ would be an error, not equivalent to 'c' to 'r' (taking the first character of each string), since those are not precomposed forms.</p>
<p>Mostly, i tend to write this because of other languages - e.g. Perl has 'a' .. 'ÿ' or whatever, as does Ruby.</p>
<p>ICU in Python has UnicodeSet('[[:Ll:]&amp;[:Latin:]]') which is powerful but grokhard (&amp; here is intersect i think).</p>
<p>Although 'a' to 'z' is probably what i've seen &amp; used most often, 'a' to 'f' and '0' to '9' are also obvious candidates.</p>

This is a first step; if the WG approves of the general approach, there will be a lot more detail to add in due course.</p>
<p>The PR addresses a number of open issues:</p>
<p>Issue #960 - flattening of results from $map??KS
Issue #711 - using annotations for navigation of JSON trees
Issue #596 - pinned values: transforming trees
Issue #350 - CompPath (composite objects path) expressions

As a result, the current status quo is very messy. Let's review where we are.</p>
<p>The eq/lt operators, given mixed operand types, convert decimal operands to double and compare as double. No change from 3.1. This comparison is not transitive in edge cases. The <code>=</code> and <code>&lt;</code> operators are defined in terms of <code>eq</code> and <code>lt</code>.</p>
<p>Map key comparisons compare as "infinite precision decimal". No change from 3.1. This comparison is now exposed as fn:atomic-equal().</p>
<p>deep-equal() refers to atomic-equal(), which is a change in behaviour from 3.1.</p>
<p>distinct-values() refers to deep-equal(), which is a change in behaviour - deliberate, because it needs to be transitive.</p>
<p>index-of() refers to eq. No change from 3.1.</p>
<p>compare() has been newly introduced; like atomic-equal() it uses infinite precision decimal for comparison.</p>
<p>sort() uses compare(). This is a change from 3.1; again needed because transitivity is important.</p>
<p>min() and max() use compare(). This is a change from 3.1.</p>
<p>The new highest() and lowest() functions use sort().</p>
<p>XSLT for-each-group refers to distinct-values().</p>
<p>XSLT xsl:sort currently refers to numeric-compare() and will presumably change to use compare().</p>
<p>XSLT xsl:merge refers to xsl:sort</p>
<p>XQuery "group by" refers to deep-equal()</p>
<p>XQuery "order by" refers to compare()</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly everything now uses decimal comparison where the operands are of mixed type</li>
<li>There are many different ways that we say this - it's often indirect. There are only two comparison methods, but you have to follow a chain of references to work out which one applies.</li>
<li>The two exceptions that still do comparison the 3.1 way (converting both operands to xs:double) are (a) the eq/lt/=/&lt; operators, and (b) the index-of and array:index-of functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are definitely things that now break. For example I was working on tests yesterday with assertions in the form deep-equal(nodes/number(.), (8.2, 5.4, 6.5)) - that is, comparing doubles to decimals. The nodes actually contain the strings "8.2", "5.4", "6.5". The test was failing because converting the string "8.2" to a double and then converting the double to a decimal does not produce the decimal value 8.2.</p>
<p>This mixed bag really doesn't seem acceptable. What options do we have?</p>
<ol>
<li>Be bold: make everything uniformly use transitive comparisons, and accept that some user code will break.</li>
<li>Be timid: use transitive comparisons only where it really matters (distinct-values, grouping, sorting) and use promotion to double everywhere else.</li>
<li>Compromise: introduce a compatibility mode, or a context option that allows users to control the behaviour, or another set of comparison operators.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

The first function is usually called <code>fold</code>, the latter is called <code>reduce</code>, but some languages (like JavaScript) pack the functionality into a single function.</p>
<p>We have the same options:</p>
<ol>
<li>We could tweak <code>fn:fold-left</code> and <code>fn:fold-right</code> in a way that the <code>zero</code> argument is ignored if it’s not explicitly supplied:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">fold-left(1 to 5, action := op('*'))
</code></pre>
<p>However, the behavior would then differ from <code>fold-left(1 to 5, (), action := op('*'))</code>, which is something we tried to avoid in more recent functions (there are functions like <code>fn:name</code>, though, that behave similarly: <code>fn:name(())</code> and <code>fn:name()</code> does something different).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>We could also introduce a separate function <code>fn:reduce</code> (or 2 variants, resp. 4 if we include arrays):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-xquery">fn:reduce(
  $input   as item()*,
  $action  as function(item()*, item()) as item()*
) as item()*
</code></pre>
<p>This would allow us to do  <code>reduce(1 to 5, op('*'))</code>, and for some people, a reduce function will be more familiar than a fold.</p>
<p>On Wikipedia, there’s a good summary on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)#In_various_languages">folds in various languages</a>.</p>

<p>One of the proposed use cases for scan-left and scan-right is for debugging calls on fold-left and fold-right. This use case requires that the callback functions in the two cases are compatible.</p>
<p>Background note: the optional position argument is modelled on Javascript, where it is permitted in all the common higher-order functions such as <code>filter</code>, <code>forEach</code>, <code>reduce</code> and <code>reduceRight</code> (which are the Javascript equivalent of fold-left and fold-right).

<p>that the second argument of the <code>$predicate</code> function is optional.</p>
<p>At least in the documentation, it would be useful to capture this in some way. Being "optional" here means that it makes sense, semantically, to supply an arity-1 function, in which case the caller will not supply the second argument.</p>
