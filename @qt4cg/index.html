<ol>
<li>
<p>Lexical substitution has little, if anything at all, to do with (dynamic) loading. Nothing is loaded from some external resource, as in the case of <strong><code>fn: load-xquery-module</code></strong> and <strong><code>fn:transform</code></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is nothing dynamic about having a predefined function that has a predefined set of possible values. In fact this could be defined as a strictly/statically defined <strong><code>map(xs:string, function(item()*, item()*) as item()*)</code></strong> with all allowed possible keys and as their values - the corresponding functions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking this into account it is suggested to move <code>fn:op</code> to a section where it truly belongs. Maybe have in this section also other features of the language that are merely lexical substitution, as for example, function(s) for the creation of type-aliases.</p>

<p>The main changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In place of the special self-reference syntax "..", we now allow recursive use of type aliases, allowing types to be mutually recursive</li>
<li>We generalise the places that recursive references are allowed, for example the record type used by fn:random-number-generator is now legal</li>
<li>Subtyping rules for recursive record types are now defined (this was previously a gap in the specification). Acknowledgements to a John Snelson blog post for pointing me in the right direction.</li>

<p>Note: the issue led to a wide-ranging discussion about possible enhancements to the type system, for example adding types for empty maps and arrays. I have ignored most of this, and have focussed on fixing the issue as raised (arising originally on the test suite), namely the incorrect use of <code>V?</code> to define a type that allows either an instance of the sequence type V or or an empty sequence.</p>

<p>At present this can be achieved by declaring a local variable bound to an anonymous function, but it's clumsy to have to use completely different syntax for local and global functions, and functions defined in this way cannot be mutually recursive.</p>
<p>I propose that such functions should shadow any global functions with the same name, in the same way as happens with local variable declarations. I have an open mind as to whether shadowing of functions in reserved namespaces should be allowed.</p>
<p>The main difficulty is the scoping rules. We don't want the problems Javascript has with "hoisting". I propose that (a) all local function declarations must appear before any instructions (or local variable declarations, but not params) within the sequence constructor, and (b) these function declarations are in-scope throughout the sequence constructor including forwards references from the body of other functions declared earlier within the same sequence constructor.</p>

<p>(b) The streamability rules are too strict. They say that the select attribute must be motionless or consuming, but this is not necessary, because the select attribute is applied to a snapshot tree, which is instantiated in memory and therefore does not need to be streamable.</p>

<p>But V is a sequence type, not an item type, so you can't just tag a '?' onto the end of it. What is intended here by <code>V?</code> is a sequence type that is the union of <code>V</code> and <code>empty-sequence()</code>.</p>

At present XQuery says nothing, and XSLT says very little.</p>
<p>XQuery 3.1 says: <em>A validate expression can be used to validate a document node or an element node with respect to the [in-scope schema definitions], using the schema validation process defined in [[XML Schema 1.0]] or [[XML Schema 1.1]].</em> This doesn't really answer the question. The "with respect to" phrase could be read as implying that ONLY the in-scope schema definitions are used. Particular problems occur if xsi:schemaLocation refers to a schema document that attempts to override or redefine the schema components that have been statically imported.</p>
<p>XSLT 3.0 says nothing of interest about what schema (=set of schema components) is used when validation is requested, though it does mention in passing that <code>xsi:schemaLocation</code> attributes might be interpreted in some way by a schema processor.</p>
<p>If we look to the behaviour of Saxon as a reference implementation, then we'll quickly find fault. There's a configuration option to control whether <code>xsi:schemaLocation</code> attributes are considered or ignored; if they are considered, then the schema components referenced are added to a global pool of schema components which are used not only to validate the document in question, but to validate any subsequent documents. We're in the process of redesigning this to do something that makes more sense.</p>
