For example:</p>
<pre><code>let $(sin, cos) := sincos(math:pi()) (: sequence :)
let $[x, y, z] := camera-angle() (: array :)
let ${r, i} := complex(1, 2) (: map :)
</code></pre>
<p>These would be equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>let $ret := sincos(math:pi()), $sin := $ret[1], $cos := $ret[2] (: sequence :)
let $ret := camera-angle(), $x := $ret?(1), $y := $ret?(2), $z := $ret?(3) (: array :)
let $ret := complex(1 ,2), $r := $ret?r, $i := $ret?i (: map :)
</code></pre>
<p>It should be possible to define the type of a component and/or the whole construct:</p>
<pre><code>let $(sin as xs:float, cos) as xs:float* := sincos(math:pi()) (: sequence :)
</code></pre>
<p>For maps, it would also be useful to rename the components, such as:</p>
<pre><code>let ${re := r, im as xs:double := i} := complex(1, 2) (: map :)
</code></pre>
<p>It should also be possible to capture any left-over items in the sequence/array/map, for example:</p>
<pre><code>let $(headings, rows) := load-csv("test.csv")
</code></pre>
<p>A destructuring declaration should be usable anywhere a variable binding can be defined.</p>
<p>It should not be an error to use the same variable name twice. This supports conventions such as using <code>_</code> for unused values. For example:</p>
<pre><code>let $[_, y, _] := camera-angle()
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>It should be possible for a library or application written in XQuery to define, access, and use custom annotations without relying on vendor extensions.</li>
<li>It should be possible for a processor or editor/IDE to check and verify user-defined annotation usage (can an annotation be used multiple times; what argument values/types are valid) to provide better validation for custom annotations.</li>
<li>It should be possible to access the details of the annotations on a function (name, argument values) so tools like xqDoc can read and format annotations without using vendor extensions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Annotation Declarations</h3>
<ol>
<li>An annotation declaration is a function declared using the <code>%annotation</code> annotation.</li>
<li>Annotation parameters must be a SequenceType that has an ItemType which is either a) a subtype of <code>union(xs:string, xs:double, xs:float, xs:decimal)*</code>, or b) <code>item()</code> (to denote any permitted literal value). <strong>Note:</strong> This is because annotation values are restricted to literal values. <strong>Note:</strong> It is therefore possible to use an EnumerationType to define a set of allowed string values (e.g. "yes" and "no").</li>
<li>If a function annotation name matches an annotation declaration in the statically-known functions using the function name resolver, it is verified using the same rules for static function calls; if there are no matching annotation declarations, then no error is issued, although an implementation may choose to issue a warning.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Annotation Tests</h3>
<ol>
<li>A new AnnotationTest (<code>annotation(...)</code>) SequenceType is provided with the same structure and semantics as a FunctionTest.</li>
<li>AnnotationTest parameters must be a SequenceType that has an ItemType which is either a) a subtype of <code>union(xs:string, xs:double, xs:float, xs:decimal)*</code>, or b) <code>item()</code> (to denote any permitted literal value). <strong>Note:</strong> This is because annotation values are restricted to literal values. <strong>Note:</strong> It is therefore possible to use an EnumerationType to define a set of allowed string values (e.g. "yes" and "no").</li>
</ol>
<h3>fn:annotations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>fn:annotations($f as function(*)) as annotation(*)*</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returns all the annotations on the function.</p>
<p>The <code>annotation</code> signature will match the signature of the annotation, so <code>%a(1, 2)</code> will have the <code>annotation(xs:integer, xs:integer)</code> annotation type.</p>
<p>If a function has multiple annotations with the same signature (e.g. <code>%values(1) %count(2)</code>) then two annotations will be returned with the same signature, referring to the different annotations.</p>
<h3>fn:annotation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>fn:annotation($f as function(*), $name as xs:QName) as annotation(*)*</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returns all the annotations on the function with the name <code>$name</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>annotation</code> signature will match the signature of the annotation, so <code>%a(1, 2)</code> will have the <code>annotation(xs:integer, xs:integer)</code> annotation type.</p>
<p>If a function has multiple annotations with the same name and signature (e.g. <code>%values(1) %values(2)</code>) then two annotations will be returned with the same signature, referring to the different annotations.</p>
<h3>fn:annotation-name</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>fn:annotation-name($annotation as annotation(*)) as xs:QName</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returns the name of the annotation.</p>
<h3>fn:annotation-arguments</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>fn:annotation-arguments($annotation as annotation(*)) as array(*)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returns the arguments passed to the associated annotation.</p>

We actually have to deal all the time with sets (not just node-sets, but sets of any-type values), and it is painful to read in the spec how two maps are compared for equality when explaing <code>fn:deep-equal()</code>:</p>
<p>"<em>If $i1 and $i2 are both ·maps·, the result is true if and only if all the following conditions apply:</em></p>
<p><em>Both maps have the same number of entries.</em></p>
<p><em>For every entry in the first map, there is an entry in the second map that:</em></p>
<p><em>has the ·same key· (note that the collation is not used when comparing keys), and</em></p>
<p><em>has the same associated value (compared using the fn:deep-equal function, under the collation supplied in the original call to fn:deep-equal).</em>"</p>
<p>When if we had the set type the above would simply say:</p>
<p>"<em>If $i1 and $i2 are both ·maps·, the result is true if and only if the sets of their keys are equal, and the corresponding values for each key in the two maps are deep-equal.</em>"</p>
<p><strong>I propose that starting with XPath 4.0</strong> we introduce the <strong>set</strong> type and define set equality, the union ( <strong>|</strong> ), intersection (<strong>intersect</strong>) and set difference (<strong>except</strong>) not only for node-sets but for sets of any-typed values.</p>
<p>Then we can have a function: <strong><code>to-set($collection as item()*) as set</code></strong>, which would produce a set (of the distinct values) of any collection-typed argument supplied to it: sequence(its distinct values) , map (a set of its entries), array (a set of its members).</p>
<p>This makes <code>fn:distinct-values()</code> almost unnecessary.</p>
<p>We will no longer have to explain in a "Remarks" section that the result of a function is "unordered" or that its order is "implementation-defined" -- just by making this function return a <strong>set</strong>.</p>
<p>How can almost all major programming languages (not even speaking of SQL), such as C#, Python and Java have a set data type / interface, but even in XPath version 4 we still have to describe it in a free language narrative?</p>

Dimitre</p>

In order to be consistent and symmetric across these types, the <code>for member</code> syntax should be extended to support maps by enumerating the key/value entries of the map.</p>
<p>Given a map of type <code>map(K, V)</code> the member RecordTest would be <code>record(key as K, value as V)</code>. Given a map of type <code>map(*)</code>, the member RecordTest would be <code>record(key, value)</code>.</p>
<p>This would allow a user to write expressions like:</p>
<pre><code>for member $entry in $map
return element { $entry?key } { $entry?value }
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> With the addition of the <code>array:values</code> and <code>map:entries</code> functions in issue #29, it is possible to avoid the need of the <code>for member</code> syntax for arrays and maps, but may be worth keeping for people who prefer the wordy style of the XPath/XQuery syntax.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The union, |, and ∪ operators are equivalent. They take two node sequences as operands and return a sequence containing all the nodes that occur in either of the operands.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> With the introduction of the <code>LocalUnionType</code>, a pre-processing step would need to map <code>∪</code> to <code>|</code> in order to avoid <code>∪(xs:string, xs:integer)</code> being valid. -- This would then mean that things like the <code>CatchErrorList</code> would then be able to use <code>∪</code>, as in <code>try {} catch err:FOER0001 ∪ err:FOER0002 {}</code>.</p>

<p><strong>This issue is about the incorrect value in the MaxK column of the "sequence-variadic" (last) row of the table titled "Number of Arguments allowed in a Function Call", which is in the section "<a href="https://qt4cg.org/branch/master/xquery-40/xpath-40-diff.html#id-static-functions">4.4.1 Static Functions</a></strong>".</p>

However, the effective call always consists of N arguments, the first N-1 of which are the values for the positional parameters of the function, and the Nth argument is an array that contains all provided variadic arguments.</p>
<p>Why an <em>array-variadic</em> function doesn't have the problems 1 and 2 above?</p>
<ol>
<li>An empty sequence can be specified in the last argument, for example: [1, (), 2]. For example:
<code>myFun($posArg1, $posArg2, ..., $posArgN_minus_1, [1, (), 2])</code></li>
<li>When no variadic arguments are supplied, the last argument of the effective function call is still supplied -- it is the empty array. For example:  <code>myFun($posArg1, $posArg2, ..., $posArgN_minus_1, [])</code></li>
</ol>

<p>It is possible to write a path expression that takes a union of different paths -- such as <code>html//(ol|ul)</code> -- however it is not possible to define a precise type that accepts that path expression in variables, parameters, or return types, so if a user does specify a type some type information is lost during the static analysis phase.</p>
<p>As such, I propose renaming <code>CatchErrorList</code> to <code>NameTestUnion</code> and making <code>ElementTest</code> and <code>AttributeTest</code> accept a <code>NameTestUnion</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[86] CatchClause ::= "catch" NameTestUnion EnclosedExpr
[87] NameTestUnion ::= NameTest ("|" NameTest)*
[212] AttributeTest ::= "attribute" "(" (NameTestUnion ("," TypeName)?)? ")"

The same applies for <code>ForExpr</code>.</p>
<p>I propose that this should be possible. In other words, make the following changes to the XPath 4.0 grammar:</p>
<pre><code>[12] ForExpr ::= SimpleForClause SimpleForClause* "return" ExprSingle
[15] LetExpr ::= SimpleLetClause SimpleLetClause* "return" ExprSingle
</code></pre>
<p>This way, a user can write the following in XPath 4.0:</p>
<pre><code>let $x := 1.0
let $y := 2.0
return $x + $y
</code></pre>
<p>in addition to the following in XPath 3.1 and earlier:</p>
<pre><code>let $x := 1.0, $y := 2.0
return $x + $y
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this does not add any new capability to XPath (in particular, for and let clauses cannot be mixed like in XQuery) as a user can define multiple let or for clauses, it just provides them with an alternative way of expressing that like they can do in XQuery (where it is common to use a series of let clauses instead of let bindings for multiple local variables).</p>

Here's a rough go at some text.</p>
<p>The purpose is to be able to include annotations at any level where elements are allowed - for example, inside an xl:variable  or template or function body. Annotations might include XTest unit tests, Schmatron rules, human-readable documentation, CSS styles, or more, and could be used by other operations than the XSLT transformation: for  example, by processing the XSLT source itself with XSLT.</p>
<p>It should be possible for the same element to be both an extension element and an annotation, but the behaviour is implementation-dependent in this case (for example, an API might allow an extension to access content or convert the annotation elements to something else on compilation).</p>
<p>XSLT instructions occurring inside annotation elements are ignored along with other content, except for xsl:fallback instructions (and their contents) if the prefix was also declared as an extension prefix and no matching extension was found. Similarly, extension attributes are discarded. The fallback behaviour might be used to support an XSLT-based implementation, for example by reading the XSLT source and processing embedded Schematron tests.</p>
<p>Attributes of annotation elements are not considered to be attribute value templates and content is not considered to be text value templates - that is, { and } are not special. However, an annotation element or attribute backed by an extension could perform such processing if an implementation supported it.  The behaviour of shadow annotation attributes and xsl:use-when is implementation defined, but expressions contained in them must be processed as elsewhere.</p>
