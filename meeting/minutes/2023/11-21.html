<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MK: General agreement that it’s a good idea. Simply saying <code>*</code> to
select everything often gave too much, so I’ve proposed a qualifyer using <code>::</code>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… Very often useful with a record test. This makes it very similar
to the way you select elements by name in a tree.</li>
<li>… Seemed equally useful for the “shallow” lookup.</li>
<li>… Deep lookup defines the concept of “recursive content”</li>
<li>… Do shallow lookup on maps and arrays.</li>
<li>… But there are no errors in this case</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DN: I find the idea really good, but I think it’s underspecified
here. What exaclty is the type of the result? If the result is a
sequence that’s not useful because the will flatten. So this should
be a sequence of singleton arrays, or maybe or an array of arrays.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… This needs to be specified, otherwise we’re hanging in the air.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MK: Like “/” and “//”, it’s a flat map operator.</li>
<li>DN: Then it’s not useful.</li>
<li>MK: There are two reasons for this, one is that it optimizes for
JSON which doesn’t have multi-member sequences within things; empty
sequence is certainly a challenge here. The problem is that if you
try to return a structured result, you can’t chain the operators
together. That becomes very unwieldy. This worked for the use cases
I tried it on.</li>
<li>DN: With this issue, I don’t think it’s workable or useful.</li>
<li>MK: It could do with presentation of more use cases and examples to
show how it is useful. Yes, those cases where you have arrays whose
members are sequences might need to be addressed differently.</li>
<li>CG: I think there are a number of use cases with this syntax. But
you shouldn’t imagine that you can do everything with this syntax.
You can use existing methods to traverse through complex nested
structures. But for simple lookups, this is really nice. This is
similar to what you can do with XML structures. These examples show
when this syntax is helpful, but clearly you can’t do everything
with it.</li>
<li>JL: I understand what DN is saying. If the return result was a
sequence of arrays, where every found thing, then you could have
sequences. If you then want to flatten it, you need a first stage
flattening of a sequence of arrays. Does <code>*</code> do that?</li>
<li>MK: I think it’s another <code>?*</code> that does it. But a lot of the reason
for these operators are to avoid them.</li>
<li>MSM: The <code>::</code> operator feels like a simple kind of predicate.</li>
<li>MK: Yes, it’s essentially equivalent to <code>[. instanceof …]</code> but it’s
much shorter to write.</li>
<li>MSM: Part of me wants to use square brackets, but I can see why we
can’t.</li>
<li>MK: It’s exactly the same for axis steps; you can’t do anything with
<code>::</code> in an axis step that you couldn’t do with a predicate.</li>
<li>DN: I didn’t understand what question MK was asking about <code>::</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
MK points to <code>LookupWildcard</code> in 4.15.3.1.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DN: We have too many uses of question marks in the language. I’m
worried about how easy it is to mistype this. It’s not like “/”
which is used just in path expressions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… It seems a bit overwhelming to me.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MK: You will get the same problem that you get with “/” and “//”
where users will use “??” instead of “?” just like they sometimes
use “//” without really understanding what it does.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… There are a lot of symbols that have multiple meanings. The <code>*</code>
has at least three distinct meanings. There’s a limited number of
ASCII punctuation symbols so we live with that.</li>
<li>… The clear analogy between single and double <code>/</code> and single and
double <code>?</code> helps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DN: The specification should make it very clear that the return type
is a flat sequence.</li>
</ul>

<p>
ACTION QT4CG-055-01: MK to clarify that the return type of the deep lookup operator is a flat sequence.
</p>

<p>
Proposal: Accept this PR.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DN: I object. I think this needs more work. Returning a flat sequence destroys all nested structure.</li>
<li>NW: Consensus seems to be in favor of adding it. DN, are you willing to
accept that consensus if your objection is clearly noted?</li>
<li>DN: Okay.</li>

See PR <a href="https://qt4cg.org/dashboard/#pr-832">#832</a>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MK: I think this needs discussion. The aim here is to do something
where the appearance to the typical user is of something reasonably
intuitive and fairly clear, despite the fact that if you think
deeply about it, there is a lot of complexity under the hood.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… We don’t have identity for maps and arrays which is troubling.</li>
<li>… The 3.1 DM spec suggests that we might want to provide IDs for
maps and arrays to support update in the future.</li>
<li>… I have always thought we could avoid that, but you do need some
sort of transient notion of identity during the update to “retrace your steps”.</li>
<li>… The other thing to say is that this is very much based on the
model of “zipper” data structures which is used in functional
programming for a number of algorithms on lists, graphs, and
such-like.</li>
<li>… The idea is that the data structures are immutable so a
modification returns a new data structure. To do that, you need at
least a transient and local notion of identity so that you can
traverse the structure successfully.</li>
<li>… The other point about this relates to CG’s comments. I’ve
defined this as a single higher-order function. My natural
instinct would probably be to define XQuery and XSLT for this, but
we can do that on top of the function. That’s a next stage: adding
syntactic sugar on top. It’s also possible that we might need
variants for doing “delete” and “insert”.</li>
<li>… I think everything can be done with an update, but it might be
easier to be able to specify delete explicitly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MK: The other problem in defining it is that we don’t have a
collective noun for maps and arrays. It would be convenient if
arrays could be treated as a special kind of map.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… There’s a significant challenge in implementing this, but one
thing I’ve learned in twenty years of doing this exercise is that
it’s better to make life difficult for the implementor than the
user.</li>
<li>… Acceptance of this does depend on demonstration of feasibility.</li>
<li>… We’ve had an implementation of ideas long these lines in Saxon
for quite a while. They haven’t been widely used, and they aren’t
as complete as this proposal, but I think it indicates that it’s
implementable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CG: I think that it’s interesting to see that one function is enough
to do everything. I’m thinking of XQuery Update and this is much
simpler. Maps and arrays are much easier because we don’t have
namespaces and such. I can still imagine that it could be helpful to
have at least a few update primitives.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… Another issue is that the syntax with function items could be a
primitive that we use to define better syntax. Many people think
in terms of special characters like in XQuery Update.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
CG shares his screen and walks through some of the examples he
describes in <a href="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/pull/832">issue #832</a>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>CG: The use of compact syntax for function chaining makes the
examples shorter, but some users that I showed it to didn’t
understand it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… Having delete and replace functions could help.</li>
<li>… We could also use an array to define the steps to traverse.</li>
<li>… Using an array syntax does limit the kinds of queries that you
can do.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>DN: In 19.2.1, in <code>op:deep-update</code>, I think the change function
should accept <code>item()*</code>, not just <code>item()</code>.</li>
<li>MK: There is definitely an issue here about whether you do updates
at the level of individual items within the value of a sequence or
map or whether you do it on the value as a whole.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… There are use cases for doing both and I’ve had problems
combining them. This proposal currently just does it at the item
level.</li>
<li>… DN is absolutely right that there are use cases where this isn’t
sufficient.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DN: This is something that we need to work upon. I quite like the
proposal is a common approach. We shouldn’t be influenced by the
fact that just the XQuery community is used to doing things a
certain way. We should be trying to unify everything.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… There are probably small changes that we could make to improve
the syntax.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MK: Another thing that’s worth looking at in this area is the
JSONPath specification.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… It provides a selector syntax for looking into maps and arrays.
The result is not just a value but also a path to a value. That’s
like the annotations in here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RD: I was wondering if it would be worth updating the XQuery Update
spec to provide update syntax sugar on top of this.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>… As CG mentioned, people are familiar with XQuery Update
expressions; being able to do that on maps and arrays would be a
nice extension to the current node facilities.</li>
<li>… That might be better than having two different ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MSM: (thumbsup)</li>
<li>MK: I don’t think the semantic style of creating a pending update
list and applying it is appropriate. But syntactically, it would be
good.</li>
<li>MSM: I just wanted to second what RD said and what I think CG said
earlier. I confess, I don’t do use the update facility very often,
but I’ve learned to use it successfully and I think syntax has a
certain appeal. Parallels would be very helpful. It won’t trouble me
if the syntax is the same but the semantics are quite different.
FWTIW.</li>
<li>DN: I think we do need to have identity of values, even though that
should be invisible to the user. If you update one, you should
duplicate “shared” copies.</li>
<li>MK: Conceptually, you have to create duplicates.</li>
</ul>

We’re running out of time, but I hope that was useful.
