Reminder: The QT4CG meeting is scheduled on UK/European civil time. The United
States has switched to daylight saving time, so the meeting will be one hour
later there until the UK/Europe also switches (on 31 March 2024).

different this time:

Reviewing the minutes where this meeting was proposed, I think it’s possible
that some of the items have been overtaken by events. I don’t see an obvious set
of issues to discuss. I propose we begin by seeing who shows up and what the
attendees want to talk about.

Possible topics:

+ Editorial best practices
+ Test management
+ Open markup questions
  + HTML presentation of records
  + Non-breaking code elements

* Any other business
