* Technical Agenda

:END:

CG proposes that our goal this week should be to close as many open
PRs as possible. I think that’s a good idea. This is the list of PRs
open today, but we might consider the entire list on Tuesday.

The chairs propose a triage approach: can we accept this PR without
discussion? Can we resolve any concerns with five minutes of
discussion? If the answer to either of those is “no”, or turns out to
be mistaken, we move on.

If we get through all the open PRs before the hour is up, we can
reconsider PRs that might take 10 minutes of discussion, or we can try
to close some open issues.

Please use comments on the PRs to attempt to get any concerns you have
resolved before Tuesday.
