   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;464: Revised narrative of normalization steps for serialization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR acts on #464 by revising the description of steps involved in normalizing a sequence that is input to serialization. I normally would wield a light editorial hand, but the issues raised in #464 as well as closer reading of the prose convinced me that a wholesale revision would be beneficial. For example, new sequences were described as if the reader already knew about them, but they are really only introduced as the last sentence in many steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have capitalized on the original version of step 1's appeal to &lt;code&gt;array:flatten&lt;/code&gt; to abbreviate the description for two of the steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
