   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;686: XQFO diagnostic function documentation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think what prompted my original ticket was the use of "output". That term is used scores of times in the specs, and it always implies the output of a function within the XPath expression. Although the term is qualified in the diagnostic functions with the adjective "trace" or "log", it's tempting to think of the function's actual output. Coming back a few weeks later, I think some gentle massaging (instead of a convoluted preamble) can help readers not make the requisite adjustment, reflected in the present PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have offered two examples that I hope show the practical side of these functions. I might have missed something though, so please chime in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
