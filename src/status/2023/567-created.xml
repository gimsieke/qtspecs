   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Errors in schema for XSLT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum E10 for XSLT 3.0 notes a number of errors in the schema for XSLT 3.0. The errata can be found in the repository at https://github.com/w3c/qtspecs/blob/master/errata/xslt-30/errata.xml but they are not published or linked from the spec; they were produced by the XSL WG after publishing 3.0 and before the group disbanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of the schema found in the 3.0 repository does not include these corrections; therefore, neither does the one in the 4.0 repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another version of the schema in the xslt30test repository, and this one does include the corrections (as far as I can see).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, new additions for changes needed for 4.0 have been applied inconsistently to the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's therefore a pressing need to bring everything back into line. A good step would be to cut out the duplication: once we've got it clean, the build process should copy qtspecs/specifications/xslt-40/src/schema-for-xslt40.xsd to xslt40-test/tests/misc/catalog/schema-for-xslt40.xsd and we should only maintain the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
