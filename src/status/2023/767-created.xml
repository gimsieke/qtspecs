   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;parse-html(): case of SVG element names&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunther Rademacher points out at https://github.com/qt4cg/qt4tests/issues/57 that the expected test results for parse-html() expect SVG elements to be output in lower case; and as far as I can see, this is consistent with the spec. But is it useful? It means we're producing XML that isn't valid according to the SVG schema, and that presumably might be rejected by tools that expect to handle valid SVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In passing, I note that it's very hard to work out from the parse-html() spec what the function actually does; it's somehow written as if it's obvious, but it never gets around to actually saying it explicitly. It also doesn't say what happens when the &lt;code&gt;method&lt;/code&gt; option is omitted, as it is in these tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, it seems that we don't have any tests that exercise the various options of the function, e.g. the ability to consue binary as well as character input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
