   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definition of HTML case-insensitive collation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The semantics of the collation URI http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/collation/html-ascii-case-insensitive are described (in F&amp;amp;O section 5.3.4) are described by reference to the HTML5 "living spec". The cross-reference to a changing spec is inevitably fragile and I suggest we make it non-normative. I also suggest that we define the ordering implied by this collation rather than leaving it implementation defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sufficient definition is: the comparison of two strings A and B under this collation delivers the same result as the comparison of ascii-lower-case(A) to ascii-lower-case(B) under the Unicode codepoint collation, where ascii-lower-case($S) function is translate($S, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", "abcedfghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we should also consider defining a collation URI that is unicode-case-blind, with the same definition except that ascii-lower-case(X) is replaced by fn:lower-case(X).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
