   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;$position argument in fold-right&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fn:fold-right (and thus array:fold-right) it's not clear how the position parameter works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears to start at 1, and then to be decremented, which seems a little weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working out what happens seems to involve reverse engineering the code, which isn't ideal. It's useful to have a formal definition of the function using code, but it shouldn't be necessary to reverse engineer 20 lines of difficult recursive code in order to get a feel for what the function does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only example given doesn't add any clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
