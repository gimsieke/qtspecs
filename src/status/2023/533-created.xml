   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;413: Spec for CSV parsing with fn:parse-csv()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a spec proposal for &lt;code&gt;fn:parse-csv()&lt;/code&gt; from #413.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried to cover off most of what was discussed in that issue, but I have avoided dealing with backlash escapes (per @ChristianGruen's early comment), sticking with the RFC 4180 quoting approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some issues with the structure where I tried to follow the existing structure of chapter 15, but that leaves the function definition in 15.4 separated by a lot of text before the wider format discussion in 15.7. The split between function def and context affects the JSON and HTML parsing functions too, so I have avoided trying to fix that as well in this PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this meets with approval, I'll squash commits and rebase before merging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
