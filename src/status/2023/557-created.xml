   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;FO (feature request) accessing and manipulating binary types&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear All,
When working with binary types currently one has to fall back to string conversions and/or extensions.
A few ideas on nice to have functions that operate on binary types:
-accessing a single byte at a specific position
-splitting binary data at byte boundary (aka binary-subsequence)
-converting to/from a sequence of byte(s)
-joining binary data together
-(optionally) loading data directly as (base64)binary (some extensions are using unparsed-text with proprietary decoding 'x-binarytobase64' to retrieve a base64 castable string)
-standard bit-wise operators and, or, xor, not, rshift, lshift&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If considered, then each needs to be discussed in detail separately -ex. which type to support signed/unsigned, 8 bit etc.-, I merely intend as conversation starter in case others encountered similar issues/limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;p.s.: Not sure if this is the right channel to raise this issue, so feel free to close/move/split accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
