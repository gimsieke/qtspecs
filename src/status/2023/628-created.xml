   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;distinct-values and duplicate-values: order of results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that a few tests have appeared in QT4tests distinct-values() that assume the order of results is "order of first appearance" (search for &lt;code&gt;assert-deep-eq&lt;/code&gt;). We should either change the tests, or change the spec to require order of first appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since no implementors have objected to these tests, it seems likely that implementations are delivering results in "order of first appearance", and if that is the case, then I think it would be a convenience to users to guarantee this in the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To allow for parallel implementations, we could say that the order is undefined if ordering mode is unordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
