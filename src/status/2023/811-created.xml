   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlight changed functions in the ToCs and headings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I should have done icons for functions that have changed as well. So now I have. I'm not convinced that the ðŸ†™ emoji is sufficiently different from the ðŸ†• emoji. Maybe I should try to make them different colors or something. But it's a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
