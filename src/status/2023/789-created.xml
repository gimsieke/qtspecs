   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serialization spec: terminology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The serialization spec makes extensive use of the phrase "an instance of the data model". This phrase is defined to be a synonym of "value" or "sequence", and it seems to add a lot of words without adding any clarity. In many cases the context makes clear that it is actually referring to a tree rooted at a document node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section 3.1 "Setting Serialization Parameters by Means of a Data Model Instance" it would be helpful to use a more specific phrase, for example "a parameter document".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere the phrase is often used to mean "the value being serialized", and again, it would be helpful to use a more specific phrase, perhaps a term that is quite distinctive such as "the payload". (It's sometimes referred to as "the result tree", but that assumes that the value being serialized is the result of a query or stylesheet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
