   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XQFO minor edits, with new examples and notes, 2 through 4.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minor edits here are motivated by clarity or localized consistency. In one case, the change of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; appears to address an important typo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have introduced select examples, to illustrate points in the corresponding rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes I have introduced need some context. Option 9 for the primary format token is somewhat vague, and the attached note of clarification stokes the imagination. I have trimmed that note for clarity (without substantive changes) but introduced a set of notes later, to help caution developers on unexpected behaviors with option 9, and secondarily to caution processor implementers on the challenges inherent in supporting this option. If  I had my druthers, I would advocate deprecating option 9. It is--to use a technical term--squishy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spec editors: I am happy to pull back on any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
