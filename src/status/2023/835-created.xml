   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review names of record types&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of record types as a thing that users will interact with seems to be increasing. There are a number of new types proposed and we should review their names to ensure that we are using a coherent naming scheme for all spec-defined record types, and that the names are good enough - that they explain what they are, and aren't too unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
