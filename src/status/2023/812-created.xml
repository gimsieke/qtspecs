   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coercion Rules: Unifications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has always been a challenge to teach the difference between a conversion, coercion, promotion, casts and treats. Of course, we cannot get rid of the complexity, but I think it’s a good step forward that the conversion rules have recently been unified in the specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we can push it even further. I would suggest…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;renaming “Coercion Rules” to “Type Coercion” (…most other sections contain rules as well),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making “Function Coercion” a subsection of “Type Coercion”, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making “Type Promotion” another subsection of “Type Coercion”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m the wrong person to decide this, but maybe the full section can be moved to the Appendix, as it’s referenced all around the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
