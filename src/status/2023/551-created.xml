   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;316: Drop the fn:differences function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #316&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft specification for fn:differences was added to the spec before we had a review process in place. The spec is complex and incomplete; issue #316 points out some of the difficulties. This PR removes it from the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that fn:deep-equal() now has a debug option which outputs diagnostic information in implementation-defined format; although not interoperable, this meets the main use case, which is to discover for diagnostic purposes why and in what way two values are not deep-equal to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
