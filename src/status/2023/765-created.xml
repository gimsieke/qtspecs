   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XQuery version declaration: upgrade to 4.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text at ยง5.1 does not yet acknowledge version="4.0".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also be a bit more precise about the syntax, which currently says that the version number is two integers separated by a dot. We should give a regular expression to be absolutely clear that we mean decimal integers, no underscores allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few other version references to tidy up at the same time, e.g. "XQuery is designed to meet the requirements identified by the W3C XML Query Working Group [[XQuery 3.1 Requirements]]."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
