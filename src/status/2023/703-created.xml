   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;129 (1): XPath and XQuery changes for introduction of context value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix #129 This replaces the previous attempt from several months ago, which had too many conflicts to be salvageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wide-ranging and pervasive change, and I would like the changes to be applied promptly and incrementally to reduce the risk of conflicts, even if further work is needed later. This first PR addresses the XQuery and XPath language specifications. Further changes (in subsequent PRs) are needed for F+O and for XSLT. There are also a couple of minor changes affecting Serialization (but none affecting the data model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
