   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removed chapter 4 from XDM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted in Slack, chapter 4 of the XDM specs is out of place. In this PR I have moved the very general material in chapter 4 to the preamble of chapter 6 (now 5), which provided the opportunity to orient the reader to the structure of that chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-references to chapter 4 have been search for and dealt with. The CSS deletion comes from my observation that there is no such class &lt;code&gt;infoset-mapping&lt;/code&gt; in the resultant HTML file; section 4's &lt;code&gt;infoset-mapping&lt;/code&gt; is an id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
