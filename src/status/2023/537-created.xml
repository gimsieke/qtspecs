   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editorial: present F&amp;amp;O examples as tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a purely editorial change to the stylesheet that formats examples in the F&amp;amp;O spec; it changes the presentation to be a two-column table containing expressions and results. The intention is to reduce clutter and to improve the readability where code samples (either expressions or results) need multi-line rendition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the vast majority of cases the change is clearly (IMHO) an improvement, but further tweaking is possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be scope for tailoring the CSS (for example, I don't like the fact that table cells are centred vertically).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the tables (e.g. parse-uri examples) take too much horizontal space; the code should be edited to reduce the line length&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples are sometimes introduced with a free-standing paragraph tag rather than with fo:preamble, which separates the introduction from the code into a separate table row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the examples that were designed for inline rendition could usefully take advantage of the opportunity to turn them into multi-line code samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
