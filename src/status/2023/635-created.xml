   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;451: Schema compatibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR addresses part (not all) of issue 451.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recognises that an application may use more than one schema; for example in a pipeline using multiple stylesheets, it must be possible for the first stylesheet to produce valid output that is valid input to the second, without requiring that the two stylesheet have absolutely identical schema imports. It recognises that there are cases (for example involving substitution groups) where two schemas X and Y may both include the same type T, but produce different results when an element is validated against T. So it defines a concept of schema compatibility and defines its limitations, especially on the semantics of item types such as &lt;code&gt;element(*,T)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;schema-element(E)&lt;/code&gt;. The rules for schema compatibility between different modules of a query and between different packages in a stylesheet are tightened up and brought into line with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
