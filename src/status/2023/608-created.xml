   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formatting Monospace (II)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bugging you again, @ndw …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feedback has been triggered by #607. I’ve moved various code examples into &lt;code&gt;eg&lt;/code&gt; blocks. In principle, the result is promising, but it produces cases such as the following one (see https://qt4cg.org/pr/607/xpath-functions-40/Overview.html):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/assets/196589/d64fd37a-2918-487c-967c-08570208d6c8" width="500"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the result is better to read if single-line and multi-line monospace is formatted identically (i.e., without lines at the top and bottom, and with a transparent background)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, it would be fine if we could get rid of the scrollbars. Often, it’s not apparent from the rendering that the presentation includes results at all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could possibly fix it by wrapping even more examples manually. That can be challenging, though, for example if long strings are used (such as &lt;code&gt;"http://www.w3.org/2013/collation/UCA?lang=en;alternate=blanked;strength=primary"&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the formatting on mobile devices (here: an Android tablet with a Chrome renderer) differs from the desktop view: code blocks are rendered much smaller than the rest. – That’s just to mention it; I’d probably be annoyed if I was tasked with fixing that.&lt;/p&gt;
