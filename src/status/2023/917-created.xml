   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better support for typed maps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit (2023-01-04)&lt;/strong&gt;: See https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/917#issuecomment-1875712638 for the most promising suggestion resulting from the discussion in this thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by #720 and concerns regarding usability and performance, it may be a big step, but couldn’t we define records as subtypes of maps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main difference would be that updates on records are only allowed as long as the resulting map matches a record definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This would allow us to return much better error messages, and to prevent users from deconstructing their own data structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could still benefit from the existing map functions… provided that we believe it's an advantage. A stricter solution would be to disallow optional map entries completely (and treating records as a separate type).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a technical point of view, data with a fixed structure can be optimized much better than a structure that changes dynamically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
