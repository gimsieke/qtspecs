   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;878 Proposed extension to subsequence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following discussion under issue #844, I decided to explore the possibility of extending subsequence() with optional parameters, with the aim of making the quartet of items-before/after/starting-with/ending-with unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the spec that results. I feel it's a good trade-off; by adding three optional parameters to &lt;code&gt;fn:subsequence&lt;/code&gt;, we can eliminate 4 functions that we are having trouble finding names for. The examples feel to me to be intuitive and readable; and there is more capability in the new function than we had before, for example by combining a predicate for the start position with an integer for the length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't explored arity-2 callbacks - these certainly need some notes and examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
