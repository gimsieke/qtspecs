   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantified expressions and "binding tuples" (Editorial)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section of the XPath specification on Quantified Expressions contains paragraph starting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The order in which test expressions are evaluated for the various binding tuples"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only place in which "binding tuples" are mentioned in connection with quantified expressions, and in XPath (as distinct from XQuery) it is the only place where tuples are mentioned at all. The paragraph could easily be rewritten to avoid introducing a new concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
