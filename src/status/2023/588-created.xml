   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incompleteness of xsl:sort specification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are problems inherited from XSLT 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of the attribute &lt;code&gt;xsl:sort/@order&lt;/code&gt; is never explained in the text; it is assumed that the meaning is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only explicit statement that the default is "ascending" is in the schema-for-xslt40, which is non-normative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schema also gives a default of "text" for the data-type attribute, which is incorrect: when data-type is set to text, values will be cast to string before comparison, which is not what happens if the actual sort key values are numeric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have added prose to define what we mean by "effective value". This clarifies that the effective value of the order attribute, if omitted, is the default value. But we don't have a systematic and formal way of saying what the default value is. This affects the result of test merge-021, which depends on deciding whether the two xsl:merge-source elements have the same effective value for "order", when one is omitted and the other is set to "ascending".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
