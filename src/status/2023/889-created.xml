   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rename "Named Function Reference"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term "named function reference" is used for a construct like &lt;code&gt;name#1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we define it as "A named function reference is an expression (written name#arity) which evaluates to a [function item]", the term "named function reference" perpetuates the incorrect assumption that it is some kind of literal or constant denoting a function item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in many cases it can be treated as just that. But not when the function is context-dependent, for example name#0 or lang#1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term is also questionable because one would assume that a "named function reference" is a reference to a "named function", but there is no such concept as a "named function".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what might be a better name? What the expression actually does (when evaluated) is to search the static context for a function definition whose name and arity range correspond, and then construct a function item that captures the relevant part of the dynamic context in its closure. It's hard to encapsulate all of that in a simple name for the construct, but I would suggest &lt;strong&gt;named function generator&lt;/strong&gt;. This is sufficiently close to the current term to be recognisable, but tries to capture the fact that it's not just a constant or literal, it's an expression that activately does something when evaluated; and it's reasonably accurate in that the result of the evaluation is a function item that has a non-absent name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
