   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying 4.0 Changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of changes in an appendix is (a) difficult to maintain (with a tendency to cause Git conflicts) and (b) remote from the places in the spec where the changes actually arise. At the same time, automated diff markup tends to give a lot of unwanted detail, highlighting changes that are purely editorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose that we try out an alternative approach. Each section/subsection with significant changes should start with an info box listing the changes, headed "Changes in 4.0". This should be rendered with a distinct colour or border to make it recognisable, and it should be possible to toggle whether the changes are shown or hidden. Changes that represent an incompatibility should be specially marked, perhaps with a device such as a warning triangle. A Î” marker (or colour highlighting) could appear in the table of contents against any section that has a &lt;code&gt;changes&lt;/code&gt; entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, the changes should be identified with custom markup: I suggest an optional &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;changes&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element immediately after &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with a sequence of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;change&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; children, each of which should contain administrative metadata (such as a link to the issue and/or PR) as well as user-readable text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For changes to F+O functions, corresponding elements should be added to the FOS catalog schema; this should replace (or generate) the current "History" section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
