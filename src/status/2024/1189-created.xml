   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function: distinct document order&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nodes resulting from path traversals are normalized by restoring document order and removing duplicates. There are use cases where this operation needs to be enforced, for which people do things like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-xquery"&gt;$nodes/.
$nodes/self::node()
$nodes union ()
$nodes except ()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…which all look arcane to occasional readers, and are prone to be accidentally optimized away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be sensible to have a helper function that makes this operation explicit, so that users have some clue that something intentional is going on. Some articles called this postprocessing step &lt;em&gt;distinct document order&lt;/em&gt;, which is why we added &lt;code&gt;util:ddo&lt;/code&gt; in the past – but I would love to find a both canonical and catchier name for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
