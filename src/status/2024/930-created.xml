   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obsolete comment under fn:deep-equal()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notes for fn:deep-equal() include the paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the contents of comments and processing instructions are significant only if these nodes appear directly as items in the two sequences being compared. The content of a comment or processing instruction that appears as a descendant of an item in one of the sequences being compared does not affect the result. However, the presence of a comment or processing instruction, if it causes a text node to be split into two text nodes, may affect the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no longer true: we fixed it so that adjacent text nodes are merged after stripping comments and PIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
