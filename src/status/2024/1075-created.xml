   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop "with" expressions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current draft includes a proposal for a "with" expression to establish the namespace context for an XPath expression. This has never been reviewed or accepted by the group. See ยง4.1 of the language specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose to raise a PR that drops this feature, in order to force discussion as to whether we want it in its current form, or to replace it with something better, or to drop it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
