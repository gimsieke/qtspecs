   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[XSLT] Need to say what happens when a capturing accumulator rule matches a non-element node&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The option capture="yes" has been added to &lt;code&gt;xsl:accumulator-rule&lt;/code&gt;; its purpose is to indicate that the entire subtree under an element is to be captured during streamed processing of the document, and is made available as an in-memory tree once the element end tag has been processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to say what happens when such a rule matches a node other than an element. I think it makes sense for the capture="yes" to be ignored, optionally with a warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
