   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;character sequence constructor 'a' to 'z'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although you can write 'a' to 'z' as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-xpath"&gt;   (string-to-codepoints('a') to string-to-codepoints('z') ! codepoints-to-string()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m not sure this is easily discoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, 'a' to 'z' is obviously dependent on the current collation - if you're using EBCDIC may the dogs help you. I’m assuming, however, any two Unicode characters could appear in the string literals, and it’d be an error to have more than one character in either string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means 'ċ' to 'ŗ’ would be an error, not equivalent to 'c' to 'r' (taking the first character of each string), since those are not precomposed forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, i tend to write this because of other languages - e.g. Perl has 'a' .. 'ÿ' or whatever, as does Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICU in Python has UnicodeSet('[[:Ll:]&amp;amp;[:Latin:]]') which is powerful but grokhard (&amp;amp; here is intersect i think).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although 'a' to 'z' is probably what i've seen &amp;amp; used most often, 'a' to 'f' and '0' to '9' are also obvious candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
