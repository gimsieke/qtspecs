   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;unparsed-text() end-of-line normalization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm uncomfortable with the backwards-incompatible change we have made to &lt;code&gt;unparsed-text()&lt;/code&gt; which now normalizes line endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's unlikely that there are many users who care about the difference between LF and CRLF line endings and want to preserve that difference; but I think it's very likely that there are users who have written application code that expects the line ending to be CRLF, where the application will break if the line ending changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be more comfortable with the change if there were an option setting to revert to the 3.1 behaviour. But my preference would be to add the option and keep the default compatible with 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for users who want to treat the file as a sequence of lines, we already introduced &lt;code&gt;unparsed-text-lines()&lt;/code&gt; so they don't have to worry about different representations of line endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
