   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reorganise F+O chapter 15 [editorial]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR reorganizes the subsections of F+O chapter 15 (the XML/HTML/JSON/CSV/IXML chapter). There is no change to content apart from a couple of introductory sentences. I'm planning to do some fine-grained work on the content in due course, but to make that easier to review it seems best to do the top-level reorganisation first. I'm therefore hoping that this PR will go through quickly "on the nod" so I can use it as a baseline for the detail changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
