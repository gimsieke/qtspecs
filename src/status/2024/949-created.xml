   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partial Function Applications: Allow return of function name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without wanting to revive #889, an important observation I picked up is that named function references and “partially applied functions without applications” can be considered identical. That is, there should be no reason to distinguish between &lt;code&gt;count#1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;count(?)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, however, partially applied functions are currently defined to lose the reference to the original function and its arity (and some Qt4 tests ensure that this is the case: https://github.com/qt4cg/qt4tests/blob/8649941e0e695ff8fb4cb27c52e99590cc88126f/misc/HigherOrderFunctions.xml#L1933).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a user perspective, I see no reason why the two cases should be treated differently, and I would argue that we should either treat them identically or (at least) allow implementations to treat them identically, i.e., allowing an implementation to return &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;function-name(count(?))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
