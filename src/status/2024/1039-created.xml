   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow dynamic collations in XQuery "order by" and "group by"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propose that in "order by" and "group by" clauses, the keyword "collation" should be followed by an expression rather than by a URILiteral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem this causes is if the expression depends on variables in the tuple stream, because obviously the collation must be selected for the tuple stream as a whole, not for each individual tuple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can solve this problem by amending the rules for the scope of variables bound in FLWOR expressions (ยง4.15.1 rule 1) so that collation expressions are excluded from the scope; or perhaps (it might be simpler) to make it a static error if the collation expression refers to a variable bound in the containing FLWOR expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the syntax allows a general expression then a simple &lt;code&gt;"quoted-string"&lt;/code&gt; will be interpreted as a &lt;code&gt;StringLiteral&lt;/code&gt; rather than a &lt;code&gt;URILiteral&lt;/code&gt;. As far as I'm aware the two things are syntactically and semantically identical so this isn't a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
