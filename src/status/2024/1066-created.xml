   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1052 Simplify the results of parse-csv&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes parse-csv to deliver the results in a simpler format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) the result structure is less deeply nested: one record with four entries
(b) the actual data is delivered as a sequence of arrays of strings, closely aligned with the result of &lt;code&gt;csv-to-arrays&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules in the spec have also been rearranged to reflect this, so the rules are now organised according to the values delivered for each of these four fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples in the spec are changed to reflect the new output format; in addition they have been editorially reorganized so each example is more self-contained, avoiding the need for extensive scrolling to find the values of variables referenced in each example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix issue #1052&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
