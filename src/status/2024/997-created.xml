   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;830 Drop F+O appendix D.4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR drops the non-normative appendix D.4, which contained illustrative user-written functions. It was a very patchy and disorganised collection of functions which were primarily there because someone had proposed adding a function to the standard library and the WG had turned down the suggestion on the grounds that users could easily write the function themselves. It's not worth the effort of rewriting the appendix to take 4.0 enhancements into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix #830&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
