   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1140 Replace 'search' with 'target' for indexing functions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close #1140&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having created the issue, per my outstanding action, I thought I'd take a quick look to see how extensive the change would be. AFAICT (though I confess to not looking exceedingly carefully), only two functions are effected. Here, for your consideration, is a PR that resolves the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
