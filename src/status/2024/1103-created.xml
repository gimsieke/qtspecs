   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSV Parsing - handling line ending normalization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During discussion of PR #1066 there was much debate about how best to handle normalization of (typically CRLF) line endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's very unlikely that CRLF line endings will make it as far as the parse-csv() function, because they will already have been normalized for example by unparsed-text(). But data can also be read in other ways, for example bin:read-binary() or sql:query() extension functions, or passed in as a string-valued parameter to a transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we should have a separate mechanism for normalizing line endings in any data, independent of CSV parsing? (But perhaps it's important to retain CRLF in quoted strings?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps CSV parsing should normalise CRLF unconditionally, without needing to set a special option for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
