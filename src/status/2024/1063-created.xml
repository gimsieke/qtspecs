   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;deep-equal() - option to compare functions liberally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have changed deep-equal() so it no longer automatically treats functions as not equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is still in practice infeasible to use deep-equal() for comparison of test results that include function items because it is not in general possible to supply an expected result that compares true to the function item actually returned. Since comparison of test results is an important use case for deep-equal, this is a serious limitation. It affects our own process that checks that output from examples in the spec is correct: the examples for parse-csv, for example, are artificially adjusted to make test comparison feasible by eliminating the function items in the result, which reduces the pedagogical value of the examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be an option such as &lt;code&gt;strict-function-comparison=true|false&lt;/code&gt;. If set to false, then the function properties such as name, arity, and signature are compared, but the function body is ignored and assumed equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
