   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules for context-dependent function references in XSLT (e.g. regex-group#1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure where we are on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does regex-group#1 capture the "current matching substrings" component of the dynamic context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XSLT 4.0 test case analyze-string-101 suggests that it does, and that this represents a change from 3.0 -- there are separate versions of the test with different expected results for the two cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ยง5.4 of the XSLT 4.0 spec still ends with the sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This rule does not extend to the XSLT extensions to the dynamic context defined in this section. If a dynamic function call is made that depends on the XSLT part of the dynamic context (for example, regex-group#1(2)), then the relevant components of the context are cleared as described in the table above.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this sentence should have been deleted, but need to track down the history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
