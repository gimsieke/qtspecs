   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;960 Pinned and labeled values&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PR introduces the concepts of pinned and labelled values and the way in which they can be used to obtain additional information about the results of a deep lookup or map/array navigation operation. The changes at this stage are confined to a new section in the data model spec introducing the concept of labeled items, and a new section in the XPath language spec showing how these are used when navigating maps and arrays. This is a first step; if the WG approves of the general approach, there will be a lot more detail to add in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PR addresses a number of open issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue #960 - flattening of results from $map??KS
Issue #711 - using annotations for navigation of JSON trees
Issue #596 - pinned values: transforming trees
Issue #350 - CompPath (composite objects path) expressions
Issue #334 - Transient properties: selection and update in maps and arrays
Issue #262 - navigation in deep-structured arrays
Issue #108 - template match using values of tunnel parameters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not claim to resolve them all, but I believe it provides the groundwork for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
