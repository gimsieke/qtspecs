   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;fn:transform() improvements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spec talks about how to invoke an XSLT 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 processor, but not a 4.0 processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no way of supplying a source document in a way that allows streaming. Saxon has added a &lt;code&gt;source-location&lt;/code&gt; parameter for this purpose; this should be in the standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the stylesheet is to read streamed input, then there also needs to be control over whether and how it does schema validation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When calling from XSLT, the best default for &lt;code&gt;base-output-uri&lt;/code&gt; is probably the value of &lt;code&gt;current-output-uri()&lt;/code&gt;. The default is currently implementation-defined, but we should recommend this possibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The post-process option was added with the aspiration that it would enable secondary result documents (xsl:result-document output) to be written directly (e.g. to filestore) as a side-effect. However, it fails to achieve this. There should probably be an option to request this even though we cannot define its semantics precisely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
