   <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More changes to drop the requirement for document-uri() uniqueness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issue #898 was about dropping this constraint that document-uri()s had to be unique and PR #905 was adopted to resolve it. However, I see that the the XPath specification still contains the following note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that given a document node $N, the result of fn:doc(fn:document-uri($N)) is $N will always be true, unless fn:document-uri($N) is an empty sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe that applies any longer, so it should be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that we need to finesse the description of &lt;em&gt;available documents&lt;/em&gt; as well. The current description was clearly written from the perspective that document URIs would be unique and there'd be a 1:1 mapping from URIs to documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
